25606	13078	Roger. Could you give us comments on how the transposition and docking went? Over.	CC
25607	13087	I thought it went pretty well, Houston, although I expect I used more gas than I've been using in the simulator. The turnaround maneuver - I went PITCH ACEL COMMAND and started to pitch up, and then when I put MANUAL, ATTITUDE PITCH back to RATE COMMAND for some reason it - it stopped its pitch rate, and I had to go back to ACCEL COMMAND and hit what I thought was an extra PROCEED on the DSKY. During the course of that, we drifted slightly further away from the S IVB than I expected. I expected to be out about 66 feet. My guess would be I was around 100 or so; and therefore, I expect I used a bit more coming back in. But, except for using a little more gas - And I'd be interested in your numbers on that - everything went nominally.	CMP

25611	13430	Roger. We're working on the pressurization of the LM now, and working off the decal with CSM-LM pressure equalization. And we're down to step 13, where we're waiting for the cabin pressure to be 5, or it should be roughly 5, before we turn the REPRESS package O2 valve to FILL. Instead of 5, we're running about 4.4. Over.	CMP
25612	13456	Roger. Stand by a second.	CC
25613	13495	And Houston, Apollo 11. We did put the REPRESS package O2 valve to FILL momentarily there at step 13, and we have filled the bottles back up partially. What's the pressure reading in there, Neil?	CMP
25614	13517	We have about 450 psi now in the three 1-pound bottles.	CMP

25622	13723	Okay. In reference to your question on this step 13 on the decal, I understand that you have used up the contents of the REPRESS O2 package and at that time, instead of being up to 5 psi, you were reading 4.4. Is that correct?	CC
25623	13747	Okay. 4.4. Yes sir.	CMP
25624	13751	Okay. And you want to know if you can go ahead and use additional oxygen to bring the command module up to 5.0 and continue the equalization? Over.	CC
25625	13760	Yes. We think it's within normal tolrarances, Bruce. We just wanted to get your concurrence before we press on with this procedure.	CMP
25626	13773	Roger, Apollo 11. Go ahead.	CC
25627	13777	Okay. We're pressing on with the procedure.	CMP
25628	13780	And 11, Houston. We have a request for you. On the service module secondary propellant fuel pressurization valve: As a precautionary measure, we'd like you to momentarily cycle the four switches to the CLOSE position and then release. As you know, we have no TM or talkback on these valve positions, and it's conceivable that one of them might also have been moved into a different position by the shock of separation. Over.	CC

We could see that the weather was good all - just about everywhere. There was one cyclonic depression in Northern Canada, in the Athabaska - probably east of Athabaska area. Greenland was clear, and it appeared to be we were seeing just the icecap in Greenland. All North Atlantic was pretty good; and Europe and Northern Africa seemed to be clear.

25746	18962	This is Houston. Roger. We concur. Out.	CC
25747	18973	11, this is Houston. We've completed the trunnion zero bias setting. You can retrieve the computer and go to BLOCK.	CC
25748	18983	Roger that. Thank you.	CDR
25749	19161	11, this is Houston. With this maneuvering to observe the slingshot, I guess we missed copying your LM/CM DELTA-P reading. Over.	CC

25767	19435	Roger. We are standing by for your birthday greetings.	CC
25768	19445	I think today is also the birthday of California, and I believe they are 200 years old, and we send them a happy birthday. And I think it's Dr. Mueller's birthday, also, and I don't think he is that old.	CDR
25769	19465	Roger. We copy. I'm looking back in the viewing room right now. I don't see him back there.	CC
25770	19473	He may not be back from the Cape yet.	CDR

25793	20383	Okay.	CMP
25794	20495	Apollo 11, this is Houston. Could you give us a - an AUTO optics check to a third star or a different star from the one you've been using?	CC
25795	20505	Sure, be glad to. I can go back and do the whole thing and pick different stars.	CMP
25796	20512	I don't think there - there's any need to do that. We'd just like to confirm it with a different star, since that roll angle was a little larger than we expected.	CC
25797	20523	Okay.	CMP
25798	20605	Apollo 11, Houston. I have a TLI-plus-11-hour PAD when you're ready to copy.	CC

25809	21528	That's for the optics calibration?	CC
25810	21531	Yes, sir.	CDR
25811	21533	Yes, indeed. I'll give them to you in just a second here.	CC
25812	21558	Roger, 11. For the optics calibration I've got 346.5 for roll, 345.0 for pitch, and 007.8 for yaw. The pen-and-ink attitude corrections in your book for P23 are good. Over.	CC
25813	21590	Okay. Thank you.	CDR

25829	23151	Okay. Sure will. We'd like for you to turn on - the fan on in O2 tank number 2, Buzz. And, 11, did you - on your optics calibrations, did you proceed or recall the program? Over.	CC
25830	23168	We recalled the program.	LMP

25848	23821	Okay. Will do.	CMP
25849	23926	Okay, Houston. Apollo 11. Here's another 49 for you. Are you getting it on the downlink?	CMP
25850	23931	Roger. We see it. Stand by.	CC
25851	24022	Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We recommend you accept the NOUN 49 display on the DSKY now. Over.	CC
25852	24034	Okay. It looks like an awful big one. We noticed that you'd moved star number 2 to the	CMP
25853	24047	Negative. We don't believe so, Apollo 11. We think that this is possibly due to some TLI dispersions, and it's probably satisfactory. So go ahead and accept this. It fits our criteria anyway that if you repeat the mark and you get an equivalent size to go ahead and accept it. And this is an equivalent size error. Over.	CC
25854	24069	Okay. We'll do it.	CMP
25855	24074	And 11, Houston. Your state vector in the LM slots are - is good. Over.	CC

25869	24823	Go ahead, Apollo 11. Over.	CC
25870	24825	Roger. Why don't you sing out when you think we've done enough battery charging on B.	LMP
25871	24830	Roger. Stand by, Buzz. Over.	CC
25872	24950	Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'll be charging battery B up until the sleep period. We'll discontinue charging at that time. Also, at about 12 25 in the flight plan, we have battery A charge. That has been deleted. Over.	CC

25874	24970	Affirmative.	CC
25875	24977	And, Houston, Apollo 11. These AUTO optics maneuvers or P23's, AUTO maneuvers, don't seem to be going to the substellar point. Can you come up with the roll, pitch, and yaw angle for the substellar point on this star? It's our second star.	CMP
25876	24991	Roger. Stand by.	CC
25877	25041	Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Your angles in the flight plan we feel are still good, 198.6 130.7, 340.0. Just slightly off than those in the flight plan. Over.	CC
25878	25056	Okay. We'll try that.	CMP
25879	25108	Charlie, state those three angles one more time. I'd like to confirm them before I maneuver.	CMP
25880	25112	Roger. Roll and pitch are slightly off than what's in the flight plan, 11. Roll is now 198.6, pitch is 1307. Over.	CC
25881	25127	Roger. Roll 198.6, pitch 130.7, and yaw 34000.	CMP
25882	25135	That's affirmative.	CC
25883	25412	Houston, Apollo 11. I think the problem here is that that attitude just is not too close to the substellar point. I'm having to maneuver quite a bit; and that's in progress now, so stand by for some marks.	CMP
25884	25425	Roger. We copy it all.	CC

25892	25875	Okay.	CMP
25893	26456	Houston, Apollo 11. Star 40 has just disappeared now in the sextant. Could the trunnion angle 47 - something be a little high?	CMP
25894	26465	Stand by.	CC
25895	26481	Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to press on to star 44. Over.	CC
25896	26486	Yes. Roger. All right. How many marks have you recorded on star 40?	CMP
25897	26489	Stand by, Mike.	CC
25898	26492	Okay.	CMP
25899	26505	11, Houston. We copied two good marks. Over.	CC
25900	26509	Okay.	CMP
25901	27180	Houston, Apollo 11.	CMP
25902	27181	Go ahead. Over.	CC
25903	27183	Roger. Forty-four is just not bright enough for this. There's a reddish glow filling the black area of the sextant, and the star is lost somewhere in there, and I cannot see it.	CMP
25904	27197	Roger. Stand by. We'll come up with another star. Over.	CC
25905	27201	Yes. I'd appreciate that.	CMP
25906	27228	Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to go on to star 45. Over.	CC
25907	27233	Okay.	CMP
25908	27234	And, Mike, we think these large DELTA-R's, NOUN 49, you're getting is really meaningful since it's been way before TLI since we had a state vector update; and we think it's normal. Over.	CC
25909	27249	Okay. Could be, Charlie. Some of the early markings, I might not have had precisely the substellar point. I think as time goes by they've been coming more accurate but old Enif here is just flat invisible.	CMP
25910	27261	Roger.	CC
25911	27289	And, Houston, Apollo 11. Understand that the same three gimbal angles you gave me should be valid for star 45 as well. Is that affirmative?	CMP
25912	27298	I'm believe that's right. Stand by one. Over.	CC
25913	27300	Okay.	CMP
25914	27303	That is negative. Stand by one.	CC
25915	27304	Okay. Because there's quite a difference between the gimbal angles you have and the gimbal angles the program wants, but with inaccurate state vector, I'm inclined not to believe the program.	CMP
25916	27316	Stand by.	CC
25917	27331	Houston, Apollo 11.LMP is back on the line.	LMP

25919	27340	Read you five-by.	LMP
25920	27342	Roger. Same, Buzz. And, 11, the angles for you are 1978 for roll, 1285 pitch, 3400 yaw.	CC
25921	27358	Okay. Just as a matter of comparison, P23 for this star would like to go to 235.66, 154.31, and 31365. Over.	CMP
25922	27375	Roger. We copy, 11. We understand that the program can give you almost an infinite combination of angles in P23, and it's not too unreasonable. If you'll stand by, we'll look at these that we see on the DSKY. Over.	CC
25923	27391	Okay. Then in the meantime I'll just go ahead and maneuver to yours. 197.8, 128.5, and 340.0.	CMP
25924	27398	Roger.	CC
25925	27804	Houston, Apollo 11.	CMP
25926	27806	Go ahead. Over.	CC
25927	27808	Okay, Charlie. If the attitude you gave me on star number 45 - The reticle is off, I'd say, a good 30 degrees in roll, and the star is not in sight. Over.	CMP
25928	27824	Roger. Stand by.	CC
25929	27827	I think something's wrong with those attitudes.	CMP
25930	27914	Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. I wondered if you have AUTO optics selected. Over.	CC
25931	27921	That's affirmative.	CMP
25932	27926	Roger. Looks like to us we need a PROCEED, Mike, to get the sextant pointed at the star. Over.	CC
25933	27935	Okay. Stand by.	CMP
25934	27990	11, Houston. Those shaft and trunnion angles were exactly what we were computing on the ground. Over.	CC
25935	28005	Okay. I'm going to trim up the attitude here and give it another try.	CMP
25936	28075	Okay. I have this star loud and clear now, Charlie, so I might as well do a bunch of marks on this one to get a good horizon count.	CMP
25937	28083	Roger. Stand by.	CC
25938	28090	It still looks like I'm far from the substellar point. However, I'm off quite a hit in roll.	CMP
25939	28098	Roger. We'd like you to mark right where it is now, Mike, and we'd like two sets of marks on this. Over.	CC
25940	28108	Okay. Fine. But the reticle is not parallel to the horizon. I'd have to move off quite a hit in order to get it parallel to that.	CMP
25941	28120	Apollo 11, Houston. Our procedures guys are saying that the reticle does not have to be parallel. Over.	CC
25942	28131	Well, then we're not at the substellar point if we're not.	CMP
25943	28134	Roger.	CC
25944	28299	Houston, you copy that NOUN 49?	CMP
25945	28301	Roger. We see it, 11. Stand by.	CC

25947	28336	Okay.	CMP
25948	28375	Do you need me to wait in the NOUN 49 display for any length of time?	CMP
25949	28381	Negative.	CC
25950	28381	Okay.	CMP
25951	28469	Okay, Charlie. I'll be glad to give you as many of these as you like.	CMP
25952	28474	Roger. We'd like six marks on star 45, Mike, and then we'll probably go back to star 2 again. Stand by. We'll have further word on that.	CC
25953	28483	Okay.	CMP
25954	28520	They seem to be getting smaller, Charlie. Are you sure you wouldn't like some more?	CMP

25961	28686	Stand by.	CC
25962	28701	Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like you to go back to star number 2 with an attitude as follows: roll 1952, pitch 1239, yaw 3400. Mike, that'll give you a trunnion angle of about 31.4. Over.	CC
25963	28725	Okay. I understand star number 2 and roll 195.2, itch 123.9, and yaw 340.0. Over.	CMP
25964	28737	That's affirmative.	CC
25965	28741	Okay.	CMP
25966	28927	Okay, Charlie. I'm there, and I've got a trunnion angle of 30.5 degrees. Again, misaligned considerably in roll and I do believe that's important to getting good marks.	CMP
25967	28940	Stand by.	CC

25980	29318	Okay, Charlie. It just appears to me that you have to have a reticle tangent to the horizon at the point at which you mark or else you're not at the substellar point; you're off laterally, and therefore you're measuring a larger trunnion angle than you should.	CMP

26111	38301	Roger. We'll check this uplink on our voice. That transmission on the TV was - We'd like to get about 10 minutes worth of signal at Goldstone so we can look at the camera quality back here at Houston for about 10 minutes or so when they patch it back into us.

26151	39981	Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've been noting some funnies on the O2 flow indicator transducer. We've kind of got a suspicion that the transducer - We expected to see an O2 flow pegged high with the waste stowage vent to VENT. It was not. We also noted some funny indications when you closed the waste stowage vent valve. We're going to continue to take a look at this through the night, and we'll be with you in the morning with an assessment of the problem. Also, we'd like to ask specifically, when you place the waste stowage vent valve to VENT, does the detent - correction - Does the arrow line up with the detent? Over.	CC
26152	40038	Stand by one, Charlie. We'll give you something on the detent.	CMP
26153	40041	Roger.	CC
26154	40048	Right now it's at CLOSED, and I lined up with CLOSED before I was at VENT; and best I can recall, it was quite accurately lined up with VENT. Would you like me to go to VENT again momentarily and see where it lines up?	CMP
26155	40062	That's negative. That question's answered. Thank you much.	CC

26167	40725	Yes. Mike's got a couple of comments cn that.	CDR
26168	40729	It's working good so far, Charlie. We've got one installed on the water gun and the other one installed on the spigot down in the LEB, and we - mention one problem with them is that they leak at the junction between the food bag and the water filter. However, with that exception, they seem to be working pretty good. We were getting some gas through initially, and I think that was just getting the system purged out to begin with; and the last tubeful we poured was almost free of bubbles. Over.	CMP
26169	40771	Roger. Sounds good. We'll check in on that problem with the SPAN guys and let you know in the morning. If you have to call us tonight, we'd like you to do it on DOWNVOICE BACKUP. We're configuring the MSFN for that mode; and as far as we can see, you're cleared for some z's. Over.	CC
26170	40793	Okay. Maybe we'll get around to lunch.	CMP

At time approximately 22 30 in the flight plan, in your postsleep checklist, and in all other postsleep checklists, we'd like you to delete the statement that says "AUTO RCS JET SELECT, 16 to ON," and what we're doing here is picking this up in the procedure for exiting PTC that's in your CSM checklist. And in the CSM checklist on page Foxtrot 9-8: if you want to turn to that, we'd like to change the order of the steps in that. Over.	CC

26189	82417	Okay. Page F 9-8. Go ahead.	LMP
26190	82420	Okay. Right now it reads, "To exit G&N PTC," then you've got a pen-and-ink change that says, "AUTO RCS SELECT, 12 MAIN A and B." And you come down to the printed step 1. We'd like to take and move the "AUTO RCS SELECT, 12 MAIN A and B" down to be the second step, so the procedure would read, "Step 1, MANUAL ATTITUDE 3, ACCEL COMMAND; Step 2 AUTO RCS SELECT, 12 MAIN A B." Step 3 would be, "Verify DAP load," and so on. Over.	CC

26222	83660	Okay. We're all listening.	CDR
26223	83663	Okay. From Jodrell Bank, England, via AP: Britain's big Jodrell Bank radio telescope stopped receiving signals from the Soviet Union's unmanned Moon shot at 5:49 EDT today. A spokesman said that it appeared the Luna 15 space ship "had gone beyond the Moon." Another Quote: "We don't think it has landed," said a spokesman for Sir Bernard Lovell, Director of the Observatory. Washington UPI: Vice President Spiro T. Agnew has called for putting a man on Mars by the year 2000, but Democratic leaders replied that priority must go to needs on Earth. Agnew, ranking government official at the Apollo 11 blastoff Wednesday, apparently was speaking for himself and not necessarily for the Nixon administration when he said, "We should, in my judgment, put a man on Mars by the end of this century." Laredo, Texas, AP: Immigration officials in Nuevo Laredo announced Wednesday that hippies will be refused tourist cards to enter Mexico unless they take a bath and get haircuts. Huberto Cazaras, Chief of Mexican Immigration in Nuevo Laredo, said authorities in Mexico City, Acapulco, and other popular tourist spots have registered complaints about the hippies. By United Press International: Initial reaction to President Nixon's granting of a holiday Monday to Federal employees so they can observe a national day of participation in the Apollo 11 Moon landing mission mostly was one of surprise. Rodney Bidner, Associated Press, London AP: Europe is Moon struck by the Apollo 11 mission. Newspapers throughout the continent fill their pages with pictures of the Saturn V rocket blasting off to forge Earth's first link with its natural satellite. And the headline writers taxed their imagination for words to hail the feat. "The greatest adventure in the history of humanity has started," declared the French newspaper Le Figaro, which devoted four pages to reports from Cape Kennedy and diagrams of the mission. The tabloid Paris Jour proclaimed, "The whole word tells them bravo." The Communists daily L'Humanite led with the launch picture and devoted its entire back page to an enthusiastic Moon report describing the countdown and launch, the astronauts' wives and families, and backgrounding lunar activities.

26228	86228	Roger. Go ahead, Houston.	CDR
26229	86230	Roger. Mike, we've got some comments on performance of P23 for today if you've got a minute to talk.	CC
26230	86240	He's all ears.	CDR
26231	86242	Yes. Go ahead.	CMP
26232	86245	Okay. For today, we'd like you on P23 to make a trunnion bias determination, prior to P23 sightings as called out in procedures, and also one afterwards. Our intent here is to check out the possibility that some sort of thermal effect may be giving you errors in the angular read-out in the sextant. The bias that you get beforehand should be incorporated, that is a PROCEED on NOUN 87 after you get two consecutive measurements equal to within 0.003 degrees. And, of course, move the trunnion off a couple of degrees between the measurements. The Earth should be a lot smaller in your field of view today. I'm , sure you're a lot more qualified to tell us about that than we are, but to ensure that you're getting a good angle measurement between the star and the Earth horizon, the sextant M-line, which is the line that runs through the two hash marks and is perpendicular to the R-line, should be parallel to the Earth horizon at the substellar point. And then the actual superimposition of the star upon the horizon can be made at any point in the field of view of the sextant: above, below, or on the M-line. We recommend the marks be made as rapidly as possible after AUTO maneuver. If you feel that the amount of time between the AUTO maneuver and the time you get ready to mark is excessive, or that you don't like that AUTO maneuver attitude when you get ready to mark, of course, you can use a VERB 94 - VERB 94 to get you back to the flashing 51 position to redo the AUTO maneuvers. Over.	CC
26233	86381	Roger. Stand by one. We're going to stop PTC, and then we'll talk about this P23.	CMP
26234	86389	Okay.	CC
26235	86530	Houston, Apollo 11.	CMP
26236	86531	Go ahead, 11.	CC
26237	86533	Okay. We're stopping PTC now and maneuvering to our P52 and optics CAL attitude. In regard to that P23, what I was trying to tell you yesterday was about that. The M-line is not anywhere parallel to the horizon at the roll, pitch, and yaw which you gave me to go to for the substellar point, and I was trying to maneuver off to get it parallel to the horizon when you all said that was not necessary.	CMP
26238	86567	Roger, 11. I guess in keeping the cups of coffee score, why you get that one.	CC
26239	86577	Well - Okay - Well, this morning, let's just see how close it comes to being parallel to the M-line. Before we started marking for the first time, it appeared that the computation of - of those three angles was somewhat off, and that I was wasting a lot of gas by going to those three angles and then having to make large attitude changes after that to get the M-line parallel. In some cases it appeared to be just an accepted attitude required, and you all said that it wasn't needed. So I was marking in some cases with the M-line not parallel. I thought perhaps you had some processor for computing that offset and making sense out of that data, but as far as I know, we've got to have the M-line parallel to the horizon.	CMP
26240	86629	Roger, 11. We don't have that capability. We do require that the M-line be parallel to the horizon in order to get a good mark. We feel that possibly the - the state vector information that you were using for your maneuver basis yesterday may have needed to be updated a little. And if you'll standby a second, we'll give you an evaluation of what we feel you'll get today by the AUTO maneuver.	CC
26241	86665	Okay.	CMP
26242	87056	Houston, Apollo 11. Over.	CMP
26243	87061	Go ahead, 11.	CC
26244	87063	Roger. I'm getting ready to do an O2 Fuel cell purge. Do you have any particulars on this? And I assume you want these one at a time, or can I triple up? Over.	CMP
26245	87073	We'd like them one at a time, and stand by. I don't think we have any sequence. You can do them in any order you want.	CC
26246	87083	Okay.	CMP
26247	87086	And we're watching you on TM down here.	CC
26248	87303	Houston, Apollo 11. You want to look at these NOUN 93's before I proceed on?	CMP

26250	87314	Okay.	CMP
26251	87372	11, this is Houston. On our TM, here, we're only seeing values in two registers. Can you read us out the contents of register 3, please?	CC
26252	87382	Register 3: minus three balls 24.	CMP
26253	87385	Roger. Minus three balls 24. And you can go ahead and proceed.	CC
26254	87396	Okay. Proceeding at this time.	CMP
26255	87418	11, Houston. After you've completed P52, we'd like to uplink you a new state vector so we can start out clean on this P23. Over.	CC
26256	87429	Okay.	CDR
26257	87442	Houston, are you observing the higher O2 flow on fuel cell 3?	CMP
26258	87454	Houston, Apollo 11. It's triggered the MASTER ALARM three times, now. There goes number 4. It goes up to about 1.4, then oscillates back down to about 1.1. Over.	CDR
26259	87470	Roger. We saw them 1.3 now on TM. Stand by a second.	CC

26261	87486	Roger. Give us ACCEPT, please.	CC
26262	87493	Roger. Done.	CMP
26263	87521	11, Houston. On your O2 flow, fuel cell 3: apparently it was flowing a little higher than the other two during purge, but the flow rate is acceptable. Over.	CC
26264	87536	Roger, It seems to be flowing a little bit more, and actually putting out more current than the other two, also. Over.	CMP

26273	87840	Roger. I'm in a good attitude here to do - I have in the sextant this last P52 star, star 37. Is that all right for the optics calibration to save some gas, or do you want to go over to star 40?	CMP
26274	87863	Star 37 will be fine for the optics calibration. And we haven't noticed a VERB 66, yet, after our state vector uplink. Over.	CC
26275	87873	Okay.	CMP
26276	87877	When you move into P23, we recommend that you use the CMC-computed angles for your AUTO maneuver and see how that works out. If it doesn't bring you up with the M-line parallel to the horizon to the substellar point, we will see if we can get you some ground-computed angles. I guess the big thing here is to make sure that the M-line is parallel to substellar points so we can get a good angular measurement. Over.	CC
26277	87906	Yes. I believe.	CMP
26278	87908	Roger. Over.	CC
26279	88165	Houston, Apollo 11. Marking on this star, I get a NOUN 87 twice in a row of five balls, so that's sufficient for a count.	CMP

26281	88180	Okay. Now I want to go to P00, and I am going to take your three angles and do a verify of 49 maneuver to your substellar point. Okay?	CMP
26282	88193	Okay. We recommend that for the first star, if we gave you a new state vector, we'd like to try the CMC-computed angles for your AUTO maneuver.	CC
26283	88207	Okay.	CMP
26284	88218	And have you hit PROCEED on this display to enter the zero?	CC

26286	88224	Okay.	CC
26287	88254	11, Houston. Over the past 2 hours we have seen a slight continuing increase in partial pressure Of CO2. Have you in fact changed the CO2 canister yet this morning? We don't need to do it right now; we'd just like to confirm it on our instrumentation - is in good shape. Over.	CC
26288	88273	No. We haven't changed any canisters this morning.	CMP
26289	88279	Okay. Then you can plan on accomplishing that after P23 is over and you've got the LEB clear.	CC
26290	88282	All right.	CMP
26291	88317	Houston, Apollo 11. We're in process of maneuvering to P23 in desired attitude. It likes roll 8.37, pitch 61.33, and yaw 339.87. Over.	CMP

26294	88342	Roger.	CC
26295	88867	Houston, Apollo 11. On this star, the AUTO maneuver works just fine. I am right at the substellar point. Everything looks beautiful except there is no star in sight. It is just not visible.	CMP
26296	88880	Roger. Is this for star 01?	CC
26297	88883	That's correct.	CMP
26298	88889	You are not getting any reflections or anything like that that would obscure your vision, are you?	CC
26299	88900	Well, of course, the Earth is pretty bright, and the black sky, instead of being black, has sort of a rosy glow to it. The star, unless it is a very bright one, is probably lost somewhere in that glow, but it is just not visible. I maneuvered the reticle considerably above the horizon to make sure that the star is not lost in the brightness below the horizon. However, even when I get the reticle considerably above the horizon so the star should be seen against the black background, it still is not visible.	CMP
26300	88936	Roger. We copy. Standby a minute, please.	CC

26303	88984	Roger. Thank you.	CC
26304	89135	It's really a fantastic sight through that sextant. A minute ago, during that AUTO maneuver, the reticle swept across the Mediterranean.

26309	89245	On our ground computers we confirm the shaft and trunnion angle that you have as being pointed at the star. However, it looks as though that shaft and trunnion angle is also pointing into the structure of the LM, so that while you will be getting the Earth's horizon, the star ... is obscured by the LM. We recommend an AUTO maneuver to the attitudes pen-and-inked into the flight plan. Roll 1772, pitch 2982 and yaw 330.0. Over.	CC

26412	96910	Did you get any usable pictures out of MILA on that first pass?	CMP
26413	96915	Not that we've seen. We had word on the voice loop that MILA reported that they had gotten a minute's worth of TV signal, and Goldstone reported that they had gotten about a minute's worth of modulation but that they weren't able to get anything off of it.	CC
26414	96935	0kay. Thanks.	CMP

26458	98144	Okay, The S-band antenna OMNI A switch to Bravo which you have now, and S-band antenna OMNI to the 0MNI position, and the high-gain track to the MANUAL position, and the pitch and yaw angles are minus 50 for pitch and yaw is 270.	CC
26459	98170	Minus 50 and 270.	LMP
26460	98229	Hey, Jim, I'm looking through the monocular now, and to coin an expression, the view is just beautiful. It's out of this world. I can see all the islands in the Mediterranean. Some larger and smaller islands of Majorca, Sardinia, and Corsica.	LMP
26461	98283	Roger. I understand that the Northern Africa - Mediterranean area is fairly clear today, huh?	CC
26462	98292	Right.	LMP
26463	98294	Yes. We see a bunch of roads with cars driving up and down, too.	CDR
26464	98299	Do you find that the monocular is any good to you, Buzz?	CC
26465	98307	Yes, It would be nicer if it had another order of magnitude of power on it. Of course, it has a tendency to jiggle around a little bit, and you might want to have some sort of a bracket. I hate to use that word though.	LMP
26466	98333	Got an anticyclone going in the southern hemisphere southeast of Brazil, and some - Well, the diameter of it must be over 2000 miles across.	LMP
26467	98355	How does the weather look up in the southern part of the western hemisphere, or up in the United States area?	CC
26468	98366	Well, you all are just beginning to come over the limb now. I can see parts of Central America, and it looks to be fairly clear there. The islands in the Caribbean are beginning to come in and rather a few streaming lines of clouds. Looks like there is a system up to the - well, off of Greenland that has some large cloud streamers extending back down to the southwest. The east coast of the U.S. is just coming into view now, and it doesn't look too bad that I can see right now. We may have some pretty good shots later on this afternoon. Over.	LMP
26469	98416	Roger. Thank you.	CC
26470	98510	Houston, Apollo 11.	LMP
26471	98514	Go ahead, 11.	CC
26472	98516	I've got a comment about the point on the Earth where the Sun's rays reflect back up toward us. In general, the color of the oceans is mostly uniform and it's bright and darker blue except for that region that's about one-eighth of an Earth's radius in diameter; and in this circular area, the blue of the water turns a grayish color, and I'm sure that's where the Sun's rays are being reflected back on up toward us. Over.	LMP
26473	98561	Roger, Buzz. We noticed the same thing. It's very similar to looking at a light shining on something like a billiard ball or a bowling ball. You get this bright spot in the blue of the water, and that turns it to sort of a grayish color.	CC
26474	98577	Yes. Is there a Navy term for that?	LMP
26475	98580	(Laughing.) A lot of gray paint.	CC
26476	98727	11, Houston.	CC
26477	98732	Go ahead, Houston.	CMP
26478	98738	Mike, are you satisfied with P23 now?	CC
26479	98743	Yes, I'm happy with the last updates we got, you know, in terms of what it did to our state vector. Still not altogether happy with the various procedures. If we could pick stars within the smaller range of trunnion angles so that you could allow P23 to pick its own maneuver and go to that substellar point and then have that star visible, that would seem to me to be the simplest and best way to do it.	CMP
26480	98774	How about the - -	CC
26481	98779	... correction on that last ...	LMP
26482	98780	How about the horizon now? Is it pretty well defined for you and no longer hazy?	CC
26483	98784	Yes. We're far enough out now that the - I think the horizon definition variation is lost in the North.	CMP
26484	98817	Hey, Jim.	LMP
26485	98823	Go ahead, Buzz.	CC
26486	98826	Looks like the best way to get a steady view through the monocular is just steady it out and let it close when it's in front of your eye, and then you kind of float up next to it so that you're not touching it at all. It has a very slow drift, and you get a better - steadier view that way.	LMP
26487	98845	Sounds good.	CC
26488	98867	How does it feel to be airborne again, Buzz?	CC
26489	98871	Well, I'll tell you, I've been having a ball floating around inside here, back and forth up to one place and back to another. It's like being outside, except more comfortable.	LMP
26490	98884	It's a lot bigger than our last vehicle.	CC
26491	98886	... kept me busy, I'm ...	CMP
26492	98890	Say again about Buzz -	CMP
26493	98891	Yes. It sure is nice in here.	LMP
26494	98893	I said it's a lot bigger than the last vehicle that Buzz and I were in.	CC
26495	98897	Oh, yes. It's been nice. I've been very busy so far. I'm looking forward to taking the afternoon off. I've been cooking, and sweeping, and almost sewing, and you know, the usual little housekeeping things.	CMP
26496	98910	It was very convenient the way they put the food preparation system right next to the NAV station.	CC
26497	98923	Everything is right next to everything in this vehicle.	CDR
26498	98928	Not if you're in the ...	LMP
26499	98933	Jim, it's been a little warm in the machine throughout yesterday and last night during the PTC. It cooled off somewhat with the windows buttoned up, and we've seen suit temperatures of about - the high 40's and cabin temperatures in the low 60's. But this seems to be still a little bit on the warm side.	CDR
26500	98968	I understand that it got a little warm during the day and cooled down a little bit when you put the shades up, but you're still a little bit warm. Do you have any moisture condensation or anything like that on the wall?	CC
26501	98980	No, we haven't been able to detect any moisture anyplace in the spacecraft. It seems to be fine.	CDR
26502	98990	One of the hydrogen filters - the one that we've got on the hot water - seems to keep flowing when you remove one of the food bags from it. Its flow rate is quite small, right near the end of one out, and that contributes a little bit of moisture to the atmosphere.	LMP
26503	99016	Yes, that hydrogen thing, it's - I'm not sure, but I think it's a backpressure problem. If the thing sees any backpressure at all, like when the bag is attached, well the flow rate will slowly decrease to where it's almost zero, and you wait, and you wait, and you wait for that last ounce. You think you have its and you remove the bag, and then you very rapidly thereafter see maybe a glob the size of a dime or a quarter come out and just hang there. That appears to be true even though the opening into the bag is not restricted.	CMP
26504	99049	Understand.	CC
26505	99054	In general, I think they do quite a good job, especially on the guns, in removing a lot of the hydrogen bubbles.	LMP
26506	99064	Have the water temperatures been good? Are you getting hot water?	CC
26507	99072	Yes. It seems reasonably warm.	LMP
26508	99077	We made three cups of coffee today. The last one - you know when all the plumbing was warmed up, the hydrogen gun and everything, was warmest of the three. I don't know who had that one - Neil, did you have that one? How was your coffee? You didn't drink it till later, did you? Anyway, it's pretty good. It's not piping hot, but it sure beats stone-cold coffee.	CMP
26509	99109	Jim, we've been sitting here a little over 20 minutes now, How does the thruster firing activity look? Are you ready to go on with this PTC?	CMP
26510	99116	Roger. Stand by.	CC
26511	99120	We're all set to go, Mike.	CC
26512	99124	Okay. I'll press on then.	CMP
26513	99359	Houston, Apollo 11. PTC has started and it looks good.	CMP
26514	99366	11, Roger. This is Houston. Roger. Out.	CC
26515	100042	Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.	CC
26516	100047	Go ahead, Houston.	CDR
26517	100049	Roger. If you're free for a couple of minutes, we have a procedure here that will let us verify the O2 flow transducer and at the same time get some more of our cabin enrichment out of the way. Over.	CC
26518	100066	Stand by.	CDR
26519	100117	Go ahead, Houston. We're ready to copy.	CDR
26520	100121	Roger. The primary purpose of this is, as I mentioned, to let us check out your O2 flow transducer. However, we still need about 2 hours' worth of cabin enrichment, so we'd like to keep the vent that we're going to set up going for this purpose. Okay. We want you to install the cabin vent quick disconnect which you'll find in compartment R-6, that is Romeo 6, on the urine connector on panel 251. When this is completed, verify that the waste stowage vent valve is closed, and then open or position the waste management overboard drain to the DUMP position. Over.	CC
26521	100180	Okay. Understand that. Install the cabin quick disconnect out of R-6 on the 251 urine connector and verify that the waste dump valve is closed, and say again the last part.	CDR
26522	100202	Roger. And then put the waste management overboard drain valve into the DUMP position. Over.	CC
26523	100216	Roger. Put the waste management overboard drain valve to the DUMP position.	CDR
26524	100220	Right. That's the one down on panel 251 also. And we'll watch your O2 flow on telemetry down here.	CC
26525	100369	Okay, Houston. That configuration is set up.	CDR
26526	100377	11, this is Houston. Say again, please.	CC
26527	100382	You do have the O2 flow transducer checkout setup accomplished.	CDR
26528	100388	Okay. Understand you have opened the drain valve at this time.	CC
26529	100393	That's ... It's in DUMP.	CDR
26530	100395	Roger. We're not getting telemetry data from you right due to low signal strength. There it comes back. I expect it'll probably take us anywhere from 15 minutes to half an hour to see an increase in O2 flow due to the size of the cabin and of course of the small size of the drain. Over.	CC
26531	100416	Roger.	CDR
26532	101236	Houston, Apollo 11.	CMP
26533	101238	Go ahead, 11.	CC
26534	101241	Roger. I've got the world in my window for a change and looking at it through the monocular, it's really something. I wish I could describe it properly. The weather is very good. South America is coming around into view. I can see on the - what appears to me to be upper horizon, a point that must be just about Seattle, Washington, and from there I can see all the way down to the southern tip of Tierra del Fuego and the southern tip of the continent.	CMP
26535	101275	Roger. Sounds like you've got a beautiful view up there.	CC
26536	101281	Absolutely fantastic. I hope the pictures come out. We,re rotating around where it's going out of view again.	CMP
26537	101289	I'm waiting to pick it up in the sextant.	LMP
26538	101294	Sounds like one of these rotating restaurants.	CC
26539	102633	Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.	CC
26540	102969	Houston, Apollo 11. Do you need some help keeping OMNI's locked on us?	LMP
26541	102975	Apollo 11, this is Houston. Negative. We had a command computer at the Madrid site go down. We had to switch over to Ascension temporarily. We're now back remoting through Madrid, and the computer is back, and we're ready to resume control of your OMNI's and full communication. Over.	CC
26542	102998	Okay. You've got it.	LMP
26543	102999	Okay. One thing that we did miss in the dropout in the noise here is your LM/CM DELTA-P reading for about 28 hours GET. Over.	CC
26544	103025	Okay. The LM/CM DELTA-P is 0.98.	LMP
26545	103030	Roger. 0.98, and what have you been reading for O2 flow on your onboard gage? Over.	CC
26546	103043	Well, right now, after we put that gadget in, we've got it back to 0.35. Before that, we were reading on scale level. I think ours is relatively correct, at least when time comes for the water accumulator to kick in at 10 seconds, it goes on up to about 0.75, 0.8, something like that.	LMP
26547	103070	This is Houston. Roger. Out.	CC
26548	103123	And, 11, this is Houston. A little more information based on our analysis of your last SPS burn: it looks like you got a good solid burn there. We show 94 psi chamber pressure and it looks like the SPS is definitely GO. Over.	CC
26549	103146	Good to heer it.	LMP
26550	103148	Roger. We thought you'd feel that way about it.	CC
26551	103161	We're right in the middle of - well either ... or salmon salad, or something like that. That's probably why we're not answering you right away.	LMP
26552	103172	Okay. Well, we don't want - -	CC
26553	103173	My compliments to the chef, that salad salmon is outstanding.	LMP
26554	103181	Roger. Understand that's the salad salmon. Over.	CC
26555	103189	Something like that, salmon salad.	LMP
26556	103191	There we go, the salmon salad, very good.	CC
26557	103197	Okay. Bruce, we're coming up on the water accumulator activity, and it's going on up to 0.85, oh, about 0.95 and it reached a peak there and then gradually dropped back on down to 0.6 now, 0.4, and it looks like it's pretty well - pretty well leveling off back down to 0.35. Over.	LMP
26558	103230	Roger, We're copying that.	CC
26559	103287	11, Houston.	CC
26560	103291	Go ahead.	CDR
26561	103292	Roger. On that 2O flow transducer down here on telemetry, our values are agreeing pretty well with what you read out onboard, and the EECOMM's have been noticing this cycle, but it still looks like the indicated rate is lower than what we would expect. We're still working on the problem, and we'll let you have a more complete diagnosis on it in a little while.	CC
26562	103323	Okay. It's a tight fix then.	CDR
26563	103324	We run a tight ship.	CMP
26564	103328	Roger. Is that music I hear in the background?	CC
26565	103335	Buzz in singing.	CMP
26566	103336	Okay.	CC
26567	103351	Pass me the sausage, man.	CMP
26568	106329	Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.	CC
26569	106333	Go ahead, Houston.	CDR
26570	106334	Roger, 11. We've been watching your activity on the DSKY there, and by selecting another major program with a VERB 37 ENTER and all that, we show you collapsing the deadband in PTC and having driven the CMC rate from 0.3 degrees per second down to 0 degrees per second, although of course, with all the AUTO RCS coils shut off, you're not firing any thrusters. 0ver.	CC
26571	106374	Okay. What do you recommend?	CDR
26572	106379	Well, you can just continue in your present configuration in PTC. However, if you go to turn any thrusters on, the CMC would then try to bring you into an attitude hold position rather than continuing with the PTC. Over.	CC
26573	106400	Roger. I understand.	CDR
26574	106401	Okay.	CC
26575	106418	And, Houston, we're just looking at you out our window here. Looks like there's a circulation of clouds that just moved east of Houston over the Gulf and Florida area. Did that have any rain in it this morning?	CDR
26576	106439	Roger. Our report from outside says that it's raining out here, and looks like you've got a pretty good eye for the weather there.	CC
26577	106449	Yes. Well, it looks like it ought to clear up pretty soon from our viewpoint. The western edge of the weather isn't wery far west of you.	CDR
26578	106460	Okay.	CC
26579	107895	Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.	CC
26580	107902	Go ahead, Houston.	CDR
26581	107903	11, this is Houston. As a result of our venting through the waste management drain, we've concluded that your O2 flow rate sensor is, in fact, malfunctioning. I mentioned when you talked us through the cyclic water accumulator dump that even though it was moving, probably indicating a higher flow rate, it didn't seem to be indicating a flow rate that is high enough; and based on that and the flow that we're getting right now, we've concluded that the transducer is malfunctioning. We'd like to continue the O2 flow for about another hour, shutting it off at about 31 hours GET, to get the O2 concentration in the vehicles up to - in the vehicles up to where it will be acceptable for LM checkout. Over.	CC
26582	107967	Okay. Does it look to you like it just has a bias on it?	CDR
26583	107985	Roger, 11. It does seem to be a bias. Looks like it has a fairly high threshold before it starts indicating. EECOMM seems to think, though, that for high flow rate purposes, it will still give you a relative indication during the mission. Over.	CC
26584	108010	Okay. We understand. Thank you.	CDR
26585	108740	Apollo 11, this is Houston. We would like you to terminate charging on battery A at GET 30 plus 15. Over.	CC
26586	108751	Okay. 30 plus 15 for battery A charge terminate.	CDR
26587	108756	Roger. Out.	CC
26588	108934	Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.	CC
26589	108941	Go ahead, Houston.	CDR
26590	108942	Roger. If you're free for a minute, I've got some updates to the P37 PAD's that we passed up to you yesterday afternoon, I guess. As a result of doing midcourse correction number 2, the DELTA-V required in the TLI plus 35, 44, and 53 PAD's have changed slightly. Over.	CC
26591	108978	Roger. Standing by to copy.	CDR
26592	108981	Okay. TLI plus 35 PAD: the DELTA-VT should be 7992 instead of 8016. TLI plus 44 - It should be 6112 instead of 6141. And TLI plus 53 - It should be 8172 instead of 8209. Read back. Over.	CC
26593	109017	Roger. Understand. 7992, 6112, 8172. Over.	CDR
26594	109025	Roger. Readback correct. Out.	CC

26599	109799	Roger.	CC
26600	109803	Ask them if they can read the numbers.	CDR

26604	109845	Roger. Stand by a minute, Goldstone.	CC
26605	109851	11, this is Houston. What numbers are you referring to? Over.	CC
26606	109860	Well, I guess if they can't see any numbers, why, it's kind of a lost cause.	CDR
26607	109864	Negative. Standby. We wanted to know - -	CC
26608	109866	...	CDR
26609	109867	We wanted to know what numbers before we asked them.	CC
26610	109872	Okay. I'm showing them the DSKY, and I'd like to know whether they can read what's showing on the DSKY, and also whether they can see P-R-O-G, V-E-R-B, and N-O-U-N. Over.	CDR
26611	109882	Roger. Stand by a second.	CC
26612	109886	Goldstone M&O, Houston CAP COMM. Over.	CC
26613	109889	CAP COMM, Goldstone. Go ahead.	CT
26614	109891	Roger. Did you copy the spacecraft request?	CC
26615	109894	That's affirmative. I am reading the numbers on our monitor here.	CT
26616	109898	Okay, that's - Roger. That's both the numbers on the DSKY itself, and the little words like PROGRAM and VERB, NOUN, COMPUTER ACTIVITY, things of this sort?	CC
26617	109918	Roger. I can read the numbers clearly. We can't distinguish what the words are, because it is a little snowy.	CT
26618	109929	Roger.	CC
26619	109931	Okay. I read VERB, NOUN, and PROGRAM.	CT
26620	109939	Roger. Do you see - Over in the lefthand corner, there's a big square one that says COMPUTER ACTIVITY, COMP ACTIVITY?	CC
26621	109945	Roger. I see a flash occasionally in that area.	CT
26622	109948	Roger. that's the one.	CC
26623	109951	Okay. It looks like he's moved the camera at this time.	CT
26624	109954	Roger.	CC
26625	109956	11, this is Houston. Goldstone M&0 reports that they can read the numbers on the DSKY. They can also read VERB, NOUN, PROGRAM, and see the COMP ACTIVITY light flashing. 0vet.	CC
26626	109969	Very good. Thank you.	CDR
26627	109971	And they also report you appear to have panned the camera over to another location now.	CC
26628	109977	Yes, we're going to work on something else.	CDR

26633	111080	That's me. How are you there?	CC
26634	111085	Oh, Just fine. How's the old White Team today?	CMP
26635	111087	Oh, the old White Team's bright-eyed and bushytailed. We're ever alert down here.	CC
26636	111093	Ever alert and ... Hey, you got any medics down there watching high grade? I'm trying to do some running in place down here, and I'm wondering just out of curiosity whether it brings my heart rate up.	CMP
26637	111104	Well, they will spring into action here momentarily. Stand by.	CC
26638	111132	Hello, 11. We see your heart beating.	CC
26639	111138	Okay, Well - look at the CDR's and the CMP's and see if they go up any. We're all running in place up here. You wouldn't believe it.	CMP
26640	111146	I'd like to see that sight. Why don't you give us a TV picture of that one.	CC
26641	111151	I think Buzz is trying. You got it.	CMP
26642	111156	Okay. It's coming in at Goldstone, Buzz. As Bruce, said, we don't have it here in the center.	CC
26643	111178	I'm afraid this isn't going to help out the PTC very much.	CMP
26644	111185	Yes. I don't know if it's a vibration or what it is, but it makes the pitch and yaw rate needles on FDAI number 1 jump up and down a little bit where we jump up and down.	CMP
26645	111199	Roger. Goldstoners say they see you running there, Mike.	CC
26646	111209	0kay.	CMP
26647	111211	Ask him what he's running from.	CDR
26648	111228	11, Houston. Mike, we see about a 96 heartbeat now.	CC
26649	111236	Okay. Thank you.	CMP
26650	111267	Well, that's about all that is reasonable, without getting hot and sweaty.	CMP
26651	111272	Roger. We copy.	CC
26652	111480	Goldstone should be getting about the best picture of the Earth we can give them right now, Charlie.	CMP
26653	111483	Roger, Mike. Thank you much.	CC
26654	111487	We've got a tittle distortion in the horizontal direction from banding on our monitor. I wonder if they're getting the same thing?	LMP
26655	111507	Stand by, Buzz. I'll let you know.	CC
26656	111509	I guess it would be more described as a waviness.	LMP
26657	111531	Goldstone M&O, Houston CAP COMM.	CC
26658	111537	Goldstone M&O.	CT
26659	111538	Okay. The crew is complaining of some horizontal banding on their monitor. Do you see that on the picture?	CC
26660	111545	Stand by.	CT
26661	111554	They wouldn't see anything now. We don't have anything in focus, Charlie.	LMP
26662	111560	Roger. He's checking on it. I'll see if they had it earlier. Stand by.	CC
26663	111568	I guess when we're showing the DSKY or when we're showing the Earth might be the better time.	CMP
26664	111574	Okay.	CC
26665	111580	Houston CAP COMM, Goldstone.	CT
26666	111582	Go ahead.	CC
26667	111583	Okay. Our TV people confirm they see this horizontal band.	CT
26668	111586	Okay.	CC
26669	111591	11, Houston. The Goldstone TV people also see the banding when - at the same time you do. Over.	CC
26670	111602	Okay. Would they call it a horizontal waviness, instead of banding, maybe?	LMP
26671	111606	I'm not talking to them directly. Stand by, Buzz. Let me see how they describe it.	CC
26672	111613	Goldstone M&0, Houston CAP COMM. Could you put the TV guy on the loop, please?	CC
26673	111619	CAP C0MM, Goldstone. Roger.	CT
26674	111661	Houston CAP COMM, Goldstone M&0 NET 1.	CT
26675	111664	Go.	CC
26676	111665	The TV people do not have access to NET 1 in that area. Suggest we use NET 2 For that purpose.	CT
26677	111670	Okay. Going to NET 2.	CC
26678	111722	Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. The Goldstone TV guys say they have some horizontal banding across the upper part of the picture and across the lower part. They would consider the lines just straight, no waviness to them at all. Over.	CC
26679	111744	Roger. Understand. They do seem to distort vertical lines though.	LMP
26680	111750	Say again about the vertical lines, Buzz.	CC
26681	111755	Roger. When there's a vertical line, these horizontal bands tend to put small waves in it.	LMP
26682	111764	Roger. I copy. He didn't mention that. Stand by, I'll check again.	CC
26683	111810	Hello, 11. Houston. The Goldstone TV said that when you get a sharp vertical line on the picture, when the horizontal banding goes across, it does appear to bend it slightly. The same as Apollo 10, they said. Looks okay to them. Over.	CC
26684	111827	Okay. Understand. It's not our monitor. It must be the transmitter or the system.	LMP
26685	111832	Roger. I guess so, Buzz. We'll have them look into it, and see if they can suggest anything.	CC
26686	111912	Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've lost our command interface with Goldstone. We'd like you to switch to 0MNI Delta. Over.	CC
26687	111924	Roger. Going to Delta.	LMP
26688	111926	Roger.	CC
26689	112040	Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to terminate the O2 purge if you have not done so already, and the TV camera people say that the lines are inherent in the camera, Buzz; and it's something that we expected. Over.	CC
26690	112061	Roger. Understand about the camera. Say again about the O2 purge.	LMP
26691	112064	Roger. We can terminate the O2 purge at this time. Over.	CC
26692	112070	Oh, okay. Fine. Will do.	LMP
26693	112398	Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Please select OMNI Bravo on board. Over.	CC
26694	112406	Okay. Going to Bravo, Charlie.	CMP
26695	112408	Roger.	CC
26696	112412	How's everything going down there? You guys happy with the spacecraft systems?	CMP
26697	112417	Roger. Affirmative. Everything's looking really good to us. Over.	CC
26698	112424	Okay. Same here.	CMP
26699	112463	Charlie, how far out can you pick up TV off the 0MNI?	CMP
26700	112467	Stand by.	CC
26701	112487	Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're just about to the limits where we can get any kind of picture at all on the OMNI's on the TV. It - The picture, I guess, would be just almost zero at this point.	CC
26702	112502	Okay. Well, for this TV program coming up in a couple of hours, you might give some thought to how you want us to stop PTC, if you do, for the best high gain angle; and also it would be nice if you could stop us at such an attitude that we'd have the Earth out of one of our windows.	CMP
26703	112521	Roger, 11. We're thinking about that.	CC
26704	112525	Okay.	CMP
26705	112728	Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We got some PIPA biases and general drift updates for you if you give us P00 and ACCEPT. Over.	CC
26706	112741	Okay, Charlie. Stant by one.	CDR
26707	112744	Roger, 11. The - -	CC
26708	112745	You've got it.	CDR
26709	112747	Okay. Thank you much. Our biggest drift on the GYRO's is 0.03 degrees per hour with - on the X-GYRO. On the PIPA's, the Y-PIPA's the biggest and it's 0.006 feet per second so ... trying to tweak it up. The biggest we have is about one sigma on both GYRO's and accelerometers.	CC
26710	112773	Sounds good.	CDR
26711	112777	The system really looks good to us.	CC
26712	112782	Glad to hear it, Charlie.	CDR
26713	112831	11, Houston. You can go back to BLOCK. We've got the load in.	CC
26714	112838	Okay. Roger.	CDR
26715	112945	Boy, you sure get a different perspective in this thing in zero g. Right now, Neil's got his feet on the forward hatch, and he can with his arms reach - all five windows, He can reach down into - the LEB where the overboard drain is. He can practically reach over in the cockpit.	LMP
26716	112953	Sounds like Plastic Man to me.	CC
26717	112980	I'm hiding under the left-hand couch trying to stay out of his way.	CMP
26718	112984	Be a good idea, Mike.	CC
26719	113118	Houston, Apollo 11. You got a cloud over the Houston area right now?	LMP
26720	113124	Roger. We just had a really big thunderstorm here about a hour ago. Couple of storms around the area ... Over.	CC
26721	113128	Yes. I see one fairly large and isolated one. There are couple of more off to the left, but this one looks fairly good size. It could very well be the one that just passed over you.	LMP
26722	113133	Roger.	CC
26723	113134	Yes, and it looks like the Cape has been having a little bit of rain, too.	LMP
26724	113147	Roger. The one we had here came in from the west and is moving east - or nearly so, as far as I could tell.	CC
26725	113159	That view through this sextant is fantastic. I can see Alaska right up - right up along the LM, and I'm running the crosshairs right now down the coast of California, the west coast of Mexico, Yucatan Peninsula, up around the Gulf, Florida, Cuba, down Central America, and I'm running into the stop right now, on the sextant.	LMP
26726	113204	Roger. It sounds like a pretty fantastic view.	CC
26727	113211	The guys in the weather office at Patrick wanted a report on the tops but I guess all we can say is we're above them.	LMP
26728	113218	Roger. We'll pass it on to METRO.	CC
26729	113229	11, Houston. Do you see any predominant weather systems as far as frontal type or any buildup of tropical-storm type? Over.	CC
26730	113245	Not any large ones. There are a couple of smaller disturbances. Well, there's one maybe 300 miles north of Cuba, but it doesn't look cyclonic.	LMP
26731	113259	Roger.	CC
26732	116698	Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We got a TV attitude for you and also an update to your CMC erasable load and your alternate contingency checklist, if you could break that out too. Over.	CC
26733	116716	Roger. I'm not sure I caught all of that. Go ahead with what you have.	LMP
26734	116723	Roger, 11. If you'll break out your alternate and contingency checklist for the CSM, we got an update to some of the erasable loads on page F2-20, Over.	CC
26735	116742	Okay. Be getting that out, and you can give us the attitude for TV.	LMP
26736	116748	Roger, 11. Your TV attitude will be roll 261, pitch 090, yaw 000. High gain angle: pitch plus 28, yaw 271. That puts the left-hand window pointed at the Earth. We recommend exiting PTC with your updated procedure in the checklist. Over.	CC
26737	116789	Roger. We copy roll 21 - 61, pitch 090, yaw 000, high gain pitch plus 28, yaw 271. And we'll like this with the DELTA-V that we have in the book. Over.	LMP
26738	116806	That's affirmative.	CC
26739	116821	Charlie, Apollo 11. I have a couple of questions on stopping the PTC. It seems to me the easiest way to stop it would be - we're essentially, of course, at 0 degrees yaw and closing up to 90 degrees pitch, so it's just a question of stopping at 260 roll, roughly, and - How about for a procedure going MANUAL ATTITUDE, three to RATE COMMAND and then, seeing as how our deadband has already collapsed, I'll turn on the panel 8 RCS thrusters, at which time it should stop at whatever attitude it finds itself in. And if I do all of that as it comes up on 261 degrees roll, we should stop right there. Is that sufficient?	CMP
26740	116870	Sounds like it might save a little gas.	CMP
26741	116946	Houston, Apollo 11. What page do you want in that revision? Over.	LMP
26742	116951	Roger, 11. If you'll turn to page F2-20. Over.	CC
26743	116968	Okay, Tim -	LMP
26744	116972	Roger, 11. Under column A on page F2-20, line 5, line 05, the new data is 01042; line 07, the new data is 00256. Skipping down to line 11, 00070; line 12 is 00042; line 13 is 77730. In column Bravo, lines 3, 4, and 5, which are blank, should be all zeros for line 3; line 4 is 20017; line 5 20616. Over.	CC
26745	117070	Roger. Page F2-20, column Alfa: 05, 01042; 07, 00256; 11, I'll say again. 11, 00070; 12, 00042; 13, 77730. Column Bravo: 03, 00000; 04, 20017; 05, 20616. Over.	LMP
26746	117129	Roger. Good readback, Buzz. And stand by, Mike, on the coming-out-of-the-PTC recommendation. Over.	CC
26747	117137	Okay. Fine.	CMP
26748	117186	Hello, Apollo 11. Houston with a recommendation on exiting PTCM. Over.	CC
26749	117193	Go ahead.	CMP
26750	117194	Roger, Mike. We'd like to see you go to ACCEL COMMAND on the MANUAL ATTITUDE switches. Then to turn on the AUTO RCS SELECT switches, and then go RATE COMMAND. That will prevent us from firing jets uncoupled. Over.	CC
26751	117216	Okay. Fine. And I would guess go RATE COMMAND and roll first and then followed by pitch and yaw.	CMP
26752	117225	Okay. That sounds good if - And when you get to the roll attitude desired, just go RATE COMMAND at that time and it'll stop us right on.	CC
26753	117238	Yes. I agree, Charlie. That sounds right.	CMP
26754	117240	Roger.	CC
26755	117551	Hello, Apollo 11. Houston with some more words on exiting PTC. Over.	CC
26756	117558	Go ahead, Charlie.	CMP
26757	117560	Roger. Mike, when you were playing with the P37 a while ago and we collapsed the deadband back down, the DAP assumed that the deadband was centered around the new attitude that we happened to be at, at that time. Since then, we've drifted out a couple of degrees in both pitch and yaw from that attitude such that if we did the procedure as we called it up to you of going ACCEL COMMAND, turning on all of the AUTO RCS SELECT switches and then RATE COMMAND, it would attempt to fly back to the pitch and yaw attitude that it had when the deadband collapsed. We can prevent that by - just immediately prior to going to RATE COMMAND on the MANUAL ATTITUDE switches, if you cycle the SPACECRAFT CONTROL switch to SCS, then back to CMC. Over.	CC
26758	117613	Sounds like a winner.	CMP
26759	117614	Okay.	CC
26760	117633	I'm not going to let these LM guys play with my DSKY anymore.	CMP
26761	117638	You sound like you'd better protect it. It looks like just about anything that you do with that DSKY is going to collapse that deadband back down.	CC
26762	117649	Understand.	CMP
26763	117794	Charlie, we just STABED to 261 degrees roll, and it looks like whoever figured it out did a good Job. It's right there, dab-smack in the middle of window number 1.	CMP
26764	117803	Sounds great.	CC
26765	117960	Looks like Houston's still got a little smog over it, Charlie.	LMP
26766	117964	We've got a constant overcast here in the room. We'll be right there. Stand by.	CC
26767	117968	Of course, a little cloud from up here probably covers 8 or 10 states.	LMP
26768	117991	11, Houston. Some of our guys just came in from outside and said it's pretty clear over the center here. It's cleared up completely. All the storms have moved on.	CC
26769	118002	Very good.	LMP
26770	118157	Oh, yes, Charlie. I can see it through the sextant now, and I can see the coastline is clear. Those clouds are just inland a few miles.	LMP
26771	118166	Okay. We copy.	CC
26772	118189	Looks like the southeast part of the country is all socked in.	LMP
26773	118204	California looks nice. The San Joaquin Valley shows up as a real dark spot with a lighter brown on either side of it. You can't tell that it's green. It looks just sort of dark gray or maybe even real dark blue.	LMP
26774	118216	How does the Mojave look? Is it clear?	CC
26775	118226	Yes. As usual.	LMP
26776	118228	Roger. The - around -	CC
26777	118229	It looks like there's some clouds just to the west of the Sierras, northeast of Bakersfield a little bit; and crossing over into the Mojave from Bakersfield looks clear; and then as you get on further to the southeast of there, there's a few clouds.	LMP
26778	118248	Roger, 11. Can you pick out Edwards in the sextant? Over.	CC
26779	118258	I can see a 104 taxiing out for takeoff on the runway.	LMP
26780	118263	Hey, man. That's super.	CC
26781	118267	These dang bastards almost always have a 104 taxiing out for takeoff.	LMP
26782	118308	11, Houston. Could you pick out anything around Edwards, a dry lake or anything? Over.	CC
26783	118316	Negative, Charlie. I just - I don't have that resolution. But to give you some idea, I can - on the lower Texas coast, I can see - knowing what I'm looking for, I can see Padre Island. I can just barely make out the fact that there's a thin spit of land and then there's a little dark zone which is the Laguna Madre between it and the mainland.	LMP
26784	118342	Roger, 11. That's pretty significant. Thank you much, Buzz.	CC
26785	118347	Right.	LMP
26786	118359	How far out are we, Charlie?	LMP
26787	118361	Stand by. I'll give it to you exactly. Looks like around 130,000, but stand by.	CC
26788	118367	Okay.	LMP
26789	118396	11, Houston. The exact range is 125,200 miles, and you're traveling 4486 feet per second.	CC
26790	118409	Pretty far and pretty slow. Just past halfway.	LMP
26791	118428	Hey, Charlie, what the latest on Luna 15?	LMP
26792	118433	Say again, Buzz? Over.	CC
26793	118438	Roger. What's the latest on Luna 15?	LMP
26794	118442	Stand by. I'll get the straight story for you.	CC
26795	121064	Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.	CC
26796	121068	Go ahead, Charlie.	CMP
26797	121070	Roger. Latest on Luna 15 - TASS reported this morning that the spacecraft was placed in orbit close to the lunar surface, and everything seems to be functioning normally on the vehicle. Sir Bernard Lovell said the craft appears to be in an orbit of about 62 nautical miles. Over.	CC
26798	121097	Okay. Thank you, Charlie.	CMP
26799	121100	And also, President Nixon has reported - or declared a day of participation on Monday for all federal employees to enable everybody to follow your activities on the surface. Many state and city governments and businesses throughout the country are also giving their employees the day off, so it looks like you're going to have a pretty large audience for the EVA.	CC
26800	121126	Oh, that's very nice, Charlie. I'll tell Neil about it.	CMP
26801	121677	Houston, Apollo 11. We've stopped PTC. We're in the right position; we're setting up for TV.	CDR
26802	121682	Roger.	CC
26803	121951	Apollo 11, Houston. We have you stopped in the PTC; attitude looks good to us. Mike, I would like to get a COMM check. The last couple of the transmissions from the spacecraft has been garbled from especially Buzz. Could you both give me a COMM check? Over.	CC
26804	121971	Roger, Charlie. Buzz here. How do you read? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.	LMP
26805	121976	Roger. You are about four-by with a slight decrease/increase in volume, sort of a wavy volume to it. Over.	CC
26806	121989	Okay. I moved my mike around. How about now? Is this any better?	LMP
26807	121992	Hey, that's beautiful right there. Thank you.	CC
26808	121997	Okay, Charlie. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. How do you read me?	CMP
26809	122001	Roger. You're five-by. Is Neil on?	CC
26810	122005	1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.	CDR
26811	122007	Roger, Neil. You're five-by.	CC
26812	122351	Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We got the network all configured for the TV. You can start any time you want. Over.	CC
26813	122385	Okay, 11. We have a picture. We see the Earth right in the center of the screen. Over.	CC
26814	122392	Roger, Houston. Apollo 11 calling in from about 130,000 miles out. And we'll zoom our camera in slowly and get the most magnification we can. Over.	CDR
26815	122406	Roger.	CC
26816	122476	11, Houston. The definition is pretty good on our monitor here. The color is not too ..., at least on this set. Could you describe what you're looking at? Over.	CC
26817	122491	Roger. You're seeing Earth, as we see it, out our left-hand window, just a little more than a half Earth. We're looking at the eastern Pacific Ocean, and the north half of the top half of the screen, we can see North America, Alaska, United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America. South America becomes invisible just off beyond the terminator or inside the shadow. We can see the oceans with a definite blue cast, see white bands of major cloud formations across the Earth, and can see coastlines, pick out the western U.S., San Joaquin Valley, the Sierra mountain range, the peninsula of Baja California, and we can see some cloud formations over southeastern U.S. There's one definite mild storm southwest of Alaska, looks like about 500 to 1000 miles, and another very minor storm showing the south end of the screen near the - or a long ways off of the equator, probably 45 degrees or more south latitude. Can pick out the browns in the landforms pretty well. Greens do not show up very well. Some greens showing along the northeastern - northwestern coast of the United States and northwestern coast of Canada.	CDR
26818	122653	Yes. They cross just south of the lower part of Mexico, probably through Central America. That is the equatorial band which we assume to be the intertropical convergence zone. The other band, which stands about 30 south, correctly appears to join the equator at the far left, or just beyond the horizon on the left edge of Earth, or at least it looks like it's going to join it. We don't have an explanation for that banding.	CDR
26819	122693	Roger, Neil. Thank you. It also appears that just to the left of the terminator, up in the northern hemisphere, there's a cloudband trending - a gap in the cloud, trending northwest/southeast. It appears to us that that comes in about over the northern United States, or perhaps the central United States. Is that about correct? Over.	CC
26820	122726	I can see on the monitor the thing you were talking about, but right now I can't get my eye to the window to pick out just where it crosses the shoreline.	CDR
26821	122735	Roger.	CC
26822	122742	You guys are doing a good job. It's a real steady picture, here. We're - Clarity is excellent. The color, it's - the clouds are - The whites are distinct. The rest if it looks like, to me anyway on the monitor I'm observing, is a fairly greenish blue is the way I'd describe it. Over.	CC
26823	122769	It appears that the - -	CC
26824	122771	Well, we can't observe much green from the spacecraft.	CDR
26825	122778	Roger. On this monitor, the landmasses appear to be just a darker grayish color rather than a brown.	CC
26826	122791	Well, it's true that we do not have the depths of color at this range that we enjoyed at 50,000 miles out. However, the oceans still are a definite blue and the continents are generally brownish in cast,	CDR
26827	122823	Roger, 11. We've been - I've just been vectored to another monitor and sure enough, the browns are coming in a lot more distinctly on the Eidephor that we have up on our screen in the control center. Over.	CC
26828	122841	Okay, world, hold on to your hat. I'm going to turn you upside-down.	CDR
26829	122870	11, that's a pretty good roll, there.	CC
26830	122883	Oh, I'd say sloppy, Charlie. Let me try that one again.	CDR
26831	122892	You'll never beat out the thunderbird.	CC
26832	122917	Apollo 11, Houston. That practice did you some good. It's looking - real smooth roll, there.	CC
26833	122923	Oops! Spoke too soon.	CC
26834	122933	I'm making myself seasick doing it, Charlie. I'll just put you back rightside-up where you belong.	CDR
26835	122938	Roger.	CC
26836	122941	You don't get to do that every day.	CDR
26837	122972	11, Houston. Could you describe, from your view, the polar cloudcap? It appears to us to extend down the western coast of North America. Would you estimate how far it extends down? Over.	CC
26838	122987	Trying to fit everybody into the window.	LMP
26839	122990	It appears that the cloudcap comes down a little bit below the southern extremity of Alaska.	CDR
26840	123003	Roger.	CC
26841	123011	We've - 11, we've lost our picture here, now.	CC
26842	123024	Okay. Apollo 11, Houston. We've got the picture back now.	CC
26843	123036	Unfortunately, we only have one window that has a view of the Earth and it's filled up with the TV camera, so your view now is probably better than ours is.	CDR
26844	123047	Roger. We copy.	CC
26845	123051	11, Houston. If you could comply, we'd like to see a little smiling faces up there, if you could give us some interior views. I'm sure everybody would like to see you. Over.	CC
26846	123066	Okay. We'll reconfigure the TV for that.	CDR
26847	123068	Roger.	CC
26848	123151	Apollo 11, Houston. It appears to us that we're seeing a view from outside plus a little of the inside. It appears you've taken the camera away from the left window now. Over.	CC
26849	123165	That's correct. We're moving it back and reconfiguring for interior lighting.	CDR
26850	123170	Roger.	CC
26851	123176	We can still see the Earth through the left window, and it appears that we can see a floodlight off to the left, either that or some Sun shafting through the hatch window.	CC
26852	123190	It's a floodlight.	CDR
26853	123191	Roger.	CC
26854	123194	Now we're coming in. Can't quite make out who that ...	CC
26855	123204	That's big Mike Collins, there - -	CC
26856	123205	You got a little bit of - Yes, hello there sports fans. You got a little bit of me, plus Neil is in the center couch, and Buzz is doing the camera work at this time.	CMP
26857	123214	Roger. It's a little dark now, 11. Maybe a bigger f-stop might help.	CC
26858	123224	Yes, that's in work.	CMP
26859	123245	It's getting a lot better now, 11. Mike, you're coming in five-by. I got a good -	CC
26860	123254	I would have put on a coat and tie if I'd known about this ahead of time.	CMP
26861	123258	Is Buzz holding your cue cards for you. Over.	CC
26862	123265	Cue cards have a no. We have no intertions of competing with the professionals, believe me. We are very comfortable up here, though. We do have a happy home. There's plenty of room for the three of us and I think we're all learning to find our favorite little corner to sit in. Zero g is very comfortable, but after a while you get to the point where you sort of get tired of rattling around and banging off the ceiling and the floor and the side, so you tend to find a little corner somewhere and put your knees up or something like that to wedge yourself in, and that seems more at home.	CMP
26863	123305	Roger. Looks like Neil is coming in five-by there, 11. Mike, see you in the background. The definition is really outstanding. The colors are good. It's a real good picture we're getting here of Commander Armstrong. We - Buzz, when you take the camera over towards the window where the Sun's shafting through, it tends to blank it out, though.	CC
26864	123335	Yes, Neil's standing on his head again. He's trying to make me nervous.	CMP
26865	123340	Roger.	CC
26866	123350	He's disappearing up into the tunnel, of course, as he would going into the lunar module, only backwards.	CMP
26867	123357	Roger. We 'can see portions of the LEB now. The systems test meter panel, in the lower part of the picture, or we did have it, anyway.	CC
26868	123369	0kay. And directly behind his head are our optical instruments, the sextant and the telescope that we use to take sightings with.	CMP
26869	123379	Roger. Copy. And we see the DSKY flashing with a 651. In fact, we can read registers 1 and 2 quite clearly.	CC
26870	123391	We have the old high gain angles telling us which way the Earth is.	CMP
26871	123395	Copy. That's a beautiful picture. Clarity is outstanding.	CC
26872	123407	We can also give you the time of day in our system of mission elapsed time. Elapsed time: 34 hours 16 minutes and umpteen seconds. Can you see that clearly enough, Charlie?	CMP
26873	123419	Roger, Apollo 11. We can see it counting up every - every second. We got 34 17 02 now.	CC
26874	123433	Okay. Back to the high-gain angles.	CMP
26875	123435	Roger.	CC
26876	123438	Now we have amputated those.	CMP
26877	123465	11, Houston. We have a beautiful rainbow there now as you move the camera around. ... That looks like the star charts coming into view, now. Over.	CC
26878	123478	Yes. Those are Buzz's two star charts that he is using right now as sun shades over the righthand window, window number 5.	CMP
26879	123487	Roger. We see the sun shining in through it behind him and plotting out the equatorial - correction, ecliptic plane, and the stars that you're using for the navigation.	CC
26880	123500	Roger. He doesn't really need the charts. He's got them memorized. They're just for show.	CMP
26881	123507	We copy.	CC
26882	123508	While we're pointing up in this direction, we see out our side windows the Sun going by and, of course, out one of our windows right now we've got the Earth. Now right behind my window, of course, we have the Sun, because the Sun is illuminating the star charts that we see. This line represents the ecliptic plane and these lines, vertical lines, represent our reference system that the spacecraft is using at this time. As we approach the Moon, the Moon will gradually grow larger and larger in size and eventually it will	LMP
26883	123559	Roger, 11. We've - Could you attempt a little bit better focus there, 11? Over.	CC
26884	123601	11, Houston. That's a lot better on the star chart now. We can make out the ecliptic plane and the planets and the Sun and the Moon as they have gone at various places throughout the ecliptic plane. Over.	CC
26885	123619	Okay, Charlie.	CMP
26886	123641	If we can get some of the wires untangled here, we'll give you a demonstration of how easy pushups are up here.	LMP
26887	123652	11, Roger. Good view of Buzz, there.	CC
26888	123684	When it gets pretty hard doing it that way, we just roll over and do it the other way.	LMP
26889	123690	Roger. We copy. We couldn't figure out whether that was a chinup or a pushup. just take your choice, I guess.	CC
26890	123725	Well, it looks like it's probably almost your dinner time down there, Earth. We'll show you our food cabinet here in a second.	CMP
26891	123734	11, Roger.	CC
26892	123758	11, Houston. We see a box full of goodies there. Over.	CC
26893	123763	We really have them, Charlie. We've got all kinds of good stuff. We've got coffee up here in the upper left and various breakfast items, bacon in little small bites, beverages like fruit drink, and over in the center part we have, oh, all kinds of things. Let me pull one out here and see what it is.	CMP
26894	123784	Roger.	CC
26895	123791	Would you believe you're looking at chicken stew, here? All you have to do is - 3 ounces of hot water for 5 or 10 minutes. Now we get our hot water out of a little spigot up here with a	CMP

26900	123845	The surgeons are saying thank you, there, for that.	CC
26901	123850	And it is sort of down in a dark corner, so we have a flashlight here to help us see things; and if I can let go of it carefully, it'll just hold itself right where it is.	CMP
26902	123864	Roger.	CC
26903	123865	As long as it's ..., it will.	CMP
26904	123876	Apollo 11, Houston. That's a pretty good demonstration. You started off really stable there, Mike. It's -	CC
26905	123884	Well, the problem is, no matter how carefully you let go, you bump it just a tiny little bit and set it in motion, and once in motion there she goes. Try that again.	CMP
26906	123900	It looks fairly stable now with slow rotation.	CC
26907	123929	Well, so much for the food department. I'm going to close up the store down here.	CMP
26908	123933	Roger. We copy.	CC

26923	124121	It's open all the way. We're going to have to move Buzz around a little bit.	CMP
26924	124124	Roger.	CC
26925	124163	Apollo 11, Houston. The color is better now. It's coming in. We could attempt a little bit better focus on it. There we go; it focuses a lot better now. We see the eagle coming right in on the lunar surface. Over. That's very good now.	CC
26926	124196	Apollo 11, Houston. That's very good now. We can see the Earth in the background, Apollo 11, and the eagle coming in.	CC

26982	126472	Houston, Apollo 11.	LMP
26983	126473	Roger, 11. The problem on that initially - starting up the PTC was we failed to do the VERB 49 which - and load the desired initial attitude; so the DAP tried to take it back to the old attitude that we had started up in number of hours to go. That's why we picked up the rates in the other axes. We're going to wait in this attitude for about 20 minutes to dump out the rates again, and than we'll proceed with the VERB 49 and load our attitude that we have at the time - at this time. Over.	CC
26984	126517	Okay. That sounds good, Charlie. When you get to the VERB 49, I'd like for you to give me the three gimbal angles that you want loaded.	CMP

When we were sitting in the 5018, we attempted to load the erasable before you terminated the VERB 49. So Mike, what we're going to have to do is call up the present CDU's, copy those down, and do a VERB 49, load the present, then do a PROCEED, then an ENTER, and then we can then set up ATTITUDE HOLD in step 6. Over.	CC
27060	129483	Okay. I think that's what we did last time.	CMP
27061	129490	It appeared to us that we attempted to load the erasable prior to entering on the VERB 49 which VERB 49 was still running, and it clobbered the CDU's. Over.	CC

Down air at the time for midcourse correction 3, which is about 53 55, we're deleting midcourse correction number 3 and all the items associated with it. For your information, the calculated value of the burn for midcourse number 3 was eight tenths of a foot per second, that is 0.8 feet per second. Canceling this, if we decide to burn midcourse correction 4, this would then give you a burn for midcourse correction 4 of 2.0 feet per second. At 53 hours we have an IMU realign P52. We're requesting that you do this while in PTC, and we plan to continue PTC throughout the day. Over.	CC

27136	173849	Okay. The battery charge is in the process now and the wastewater dump is in work. MCC 3 has been canceled. It would have been 0.8 feet per second. MCC 4 now looks like about 2.4 feet per second. At around 53 hours we'll do a P52 in PTC. Over.	LMP
27137	173876	Roger, 11. The magnitudes of the midcourse corrections were just for your information, but midcourse 4 was down around 2.0 feet per second. Again, for your information, on SPS chamber pressure, it looks like your onboard readout of 87 psi corresponds to 92 psi by our telemetry, and your value of 89 on board corresponds to 94. Over.	CC

27146	174002	Okay. Consumables update for GET of 46 plus 00: minus 5.5 percent, minus 6.5 percent, minus 2.5 percent, minus 7.5 percent, minus 5.0 percent, minus 2 pounds hydrogen, plus 1 pound oxygen, and that minus 5.5 percent on the RCS total corresponds to minus 66 pounds. Over.	CC
27147	174054	Okay. I copy those, and I'll give you our percentages now: Alpha 82, Bravo 84, Cocoa 85, Delta 87. Over.	LMP
27148	174067	This is Houston. We copy your percentages, and do you have a crew status report on sleep For us?	CC
27149	174084	Roger. And in descending oeder 8, 9, and 8. Over.	LMP
27150	174090	Houston. Roger. Out.	CC

27152	174182	Roger. We copy.	CC
27153	174755	Houston, Apollo 11. We've got the continent of Africa ... facing toward us right now, and of course, everything's getting smaller and smaller as time goes on. The Mediterranean is completely clear. The Sun looks like it's about to set around Madagascar. The equatorial belt of Africa stands out quite clearly. We're seeing the dark green or a muddy colored green, compared to the sandier colors in the southern tip of Africa and, of course, the Sahara northern coast of Africa. There's a rather remarkable cloud that appears in the vicinity of the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. It's just about to go into the sunset now. It is casting quite a large shadow. It's isolated. There don't seem to be any other clouds ... the band of clouds near the tropical conversions clouds down around the equator clearly separate the clockwise and the counterclockwise cloud formations. Over.	LMP
27154	174837	Roger, 11. We copy your word description on that. I understand you can see a shadow being cast by that cloud over between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Any estimate on how long that shadow would be? Over.	CC
27155	174858	It looks like it's a shadow. Coming around to - back that way - -	LMP
27156	174873	We're getting a lot of background noise now, also. If you will stand by a minute or so until we roll a little further in PTC, I think things will get better.	CC
27157	174884	Okay. It's coming around to the number 1 window. We'll get you ...	LMP
27158	174889	Roger, we're hearing you.	CC
27159	175022	11, this is Houston. The noise on the COMM seems to have quieted down now. I guess that we've rotated a new antenna into view and probably also the Earth out of view in your window. Over.	CC
27160	175037	Okay. It looks as though the length of the shadow of that cloud is about the same as the width of the Persian Gulf.	LMP
27161	175046	Okay. We copy the width of the Persian Gulf, and I guess that all I can give you firsthand is a single isolated data point, and that is that it was clear here in Houston this morning. That's a pretty localized observation. As a result of your waste water dump, it looks like the PTC mode has been disturbed somewhat. We're showing you about 20 degrees out in pitch right now and about 6 degrees in yaw, which is significantly greater, about twice as much - a little more than twice as much as the deviation you had prior to the waste water dump. We' re watching it down here, though, and we'll let you know if we think any corrective action is required. Over.	CC
27162	175094	Okay. Maybe we ought to - next time split that in half, and put half of it on one side and half on the other or something like that.	LMP
27163	175105	Yes. We could do that. We were actually pretty interested in seeing what the effect on PTC would be of the waste water dump. We don't recall ever having performed a waste water dump during PTC on previous missions. Over.	CC
27164	175124	Well, now we know.	LMP
27165	175126	Roger.	CC
27166	175374	Houston, Apollo 11. I am looking at that cloud now around Pakistan through the sextant, and it appears to be one single cell in the latter stages of development. There is a smaller, more isolated one - -	LMP
27167	175538	Apollo 11, this is Houston. We lost you down in the noise on the COMM link here about the time you were describing the single cell cloud formation over Afghanistan-Pakistan area through the sextant. Over.	CC
27168	175555	Roger. It came through a lot clearer through the sextant than with the monocular, and you could definitely tell it was one single cell in the latter stages of development. It must have gone up to over 50,000 feet, though. The eastern Mediterranean is phenomenally clear. You can see all the lakes; the Dead Sea stood out quite well. Over.	LMP
27169	175584	Roger. What appears to be the limit of resolution through that sextant from your current position? Over.	CC
27170	175599	Well, I can't see it right now. It's outside the field of view.	LMP
27171	175603	Roger.	CC
27172	175604	And, I don't know yow you'd really describe the limit of resolution. I will think about that a little.	LMP
27173	175610	Okay. I guess the smallest object that you could pick out looking through it would give us a pretty good hack.	CC
27174	175620	Well, you can see the Nile River going almost up to its source. The lake is obscured by clouds, but you can trace it all the way on up.	LMP
27175	175634	Roger.	CC
27176	175640	I guess that is down though, isn't it?	LMP
27177	175719	Apollo 11, Houston.	CC
27178	175726	Go ahead, Houston.	CMP
27179	175728	Roger. We have been working under the assumption that it would take about an hour for the interference from a waste water dump to dissipate to the point where you could reasonably take star sightings for platform alignment navigation or something of this sort. If you have a spare minute or two, could you comment on the observation condition, now? Over.	CC
27180	175759	Yes. Stand by one, Bruce.	CMP
27181	175761	Okay.	CC
27182	175784	My guess would be the telescope's probably pretty useless, but you can differentiate in the sextant between water droplets and stars by the difference in their motions.	CMP
27183	175802	Okay, Mike. I guess that we've still got - what you are saying is that we've still got a lot of water droplets visible, but you can pick them out and distinguish them in the sextant, then.	CC
27184	175813	Right. I think so. Buzz is looking through it now. Just a second.	CMP
27185	175817	Okay.	CC
27186	176196	Houston, Apollo 11. It looks like at this time the sextant would be quite usable for any alignment. There's actually very few ... verticals.	LMP
27187	176210	Roger, Buzz. How about the telescope? Is it useful now?	CC
27188	176222	Well, it's not quite as useful; it never seems to be. Depending on the position of the Sun, it's got that band that seems to go across the center. I don't think it's because of the waste water particles that it would lack its effectiveness. Over.	LMP
27189	176242	Roger. What - Is this band something that's deposited on the outside of the optics? Over.	CC
27190	176251	No. I see the reflection from the Sun.	LMP
27191	176255	Roger.	CC
27192	176261	The Sun bounces off the LM structure. With the LM attached, that telescope is just about useless. Those star charts that MPAD provided us, I think, would be most useful if we had to use the - if for some reason we had to mark through the telescope. We could use those as a guide for what we're looking at and say, "Well, that bright blob over there has got to be that star because that's the position we're in." But so far, we've not been able to pick out any decent star patterns while docked with the LM using the telescope.	CMP

27200	178884	Roger. You're coming back a little scratchy. It,looks like our O2 flow transducer's gotten a good bit worse. I just looked at it at the last water accumulator cycling, and it just barely registered - barely crept up above 0.2. Over.	LMP
27201	178905	Roger.	CC
27202	178960	11, this is Houston. At the time of your cyclic accumulator stroking, we were on low-bit-rate data, and consequently not receiving the O2 flow parameter. We expect that what you're seeing is probably nominal. That is, it's probably what we would expect from a transducer that's malfunctioning probably in this fashion, and it's just going to keep on getting worse like that. Nothing to worry about. We'll monitor things on the ground here. Over.	CC

27257	194103	Roger. In Washington, the Senate Finance Committee has approved extension of the income tax surtax, but a Senate vote on the bill currently seemed remote. In Austin, State Representative Ray Lemmon of Houston has been nominated as the National Director of the American Society for Oceanography. Lemmon has proposed a study of the possibility of establishing an institute of oceanography in Texas. This would be the first such institute on the western Gulf of Mexico.	CC
27258	194199	In sports, the Houston Oilers are showing plenty of enthusiasm in their early preseason workouts at Kerrville, and Coach Wally Lemm says he is impressed with the fine group of rookies. National League baseball yesterday, Thursday: St. Louis 11, Philadelphia 3; Montreal 5, over Pittsburg 4; Atlanta 12, Cincinnati 2; San Fransciso 14, and Los Angeles 13. American League: we have Baltimore 3, over Cleveland 2; Detroit 4 to Washington's 3; Minnesota 8 to Chicago 5. Boston at New York was rained out.

27268	194310	Roger. Are you having any difficulties with gas in the food bags like the 10 crew reported?	CC
27269	194320	Well, that's intermittently affirmative, Bruce. We have these two hydrogen filters, which work fine as long as you don't hook them up to a food bag. But the entry way into the food bag has enough back pressure to cause the - the filters to start losing their efficiency. A couple of times, I've been tempted to go through that dryout procedure, but we found that simply by leaving the filters alone for a couple of hours, their efficiency seems to be restored.	CMP
27270	194354	Roger. We copy.	CC
27271	194363	Their efficiency ranges anywhere from darn near perfect to terrible just depending on the individual characteristics of the food bags we're putting through them. Some of the food bags are so crimped near the entry-way that there's no way we can work them loose to prevent back pressure.	CMP

27275	196472	Hello, Houston. Go ahead.	CDR
27276	196473	Roger, 11. As you've probably noticed, your coning angle in PTC mode is increased substantially as a result of the waste water dump, the fuel cell purge, and a natural coupling, so it looks like we are going to have to terminate PTC here in a little while. And we'd like to get your feeling as to whether you're still anticipating trying to send back TV signals from inside the LM; and if so, we'll try to provide an attitude that you can hold that'll give us high gain antenna lock on the Earth during the TV and LM activation period. Over.	CC
27277	196518	Yes, we're still planning that activity if the cord lengths work out all right, and we'll accept those attitudes that you work up for us.	CDR
27278	196529	This is Houston. Roger. Out.	CC
27279	196534	When you work up an attitude to get high gain, is there any way that we could get partial Sun in one of the two LM front windows?	LMP

27284	196772	Go ahead. Ready to copy.	CMP
27285	196775	Okay. We recommend stopping PTC at GET of 54 45 00, and this should put you at just about the right roll angle. The attitude we recommend is roll 263, pitch 090, yaw 000. This gives you the Earth out of window number 1 in the command module and places the high gain antenna in the CSM window for TV at your convenience. You will also have the Sun shining in - or shining at the hatch on the LM, and if you take down the window shades you should get some sunlight in. We're recommending wide deadband. Over.	CC
27286	196836	Roger. Thank you, Houston. We'll look at that.	CMP
27287	196841	Roger. Out.	CC

27337	197875	Roger. We copy. We're reading the same.	CC
27338	197880	Okay.	CMP
27339	197886	Yes, open it back to the one o'clock position.	CMP
27340	197890	Roger.	CC
27341	197911	Is that enough different positions, or you want more, Charlie?	CMP
27342	197916	Mike, that's good - good enough. We're satisfied now. Over.	CC
27343	197922	Okay.	CMP
27344	198122	Houston, Apollo 11. We've terminated direct O2, our cabin pressure is 57, and, as a matter of curiosity, when we turn the DIRECT O2 valve OFF, we get a master alarm just like they did in the spacecraft testing.	CMP
27345	198137	Roger.	CC
27346	198140	11, Houston, we have a little update for you. When you go into the LM, we'd like you to unstow and bring back to the command module the following items. Over.	CC
27347	198155	Ready to copy.	CMP
27348	198156	Roger. We'd like you to pick up the - out of the flight data file, the surface checklist, the mission rules NO-GO card, the DPS, APS, RCS limit cue card. Over.	CC
27349	198274	Apollo 11, Houston. The reason we wanted you to bring those three items back, we'll have some updates for you, for those three. Over.	CC
27350	198285	Roger. We figured you would.	CMP
27351	198598	Apollo 11, Houston. We're getting the TV at Goldstone. We're not quite configured here at Houston for the transmission. We'll be up in a couple of minutes. Over.	CC
27352	198613	Roger. This is just for free. This isn't what we had in mind.	CMP
27353	198617	Roger.	CC
27354	199189	Apollo 11, Houston. It's a pretty good show here. It looks like you almost got the probe out.	CC
27355	199194	Yes, it's loose now.	CMP
27356	199195	Can you see that?	CDR
27357	199198	Roger, Neil. It's really good.	CC
27358	199203	Not much light up in that area, but apparently the TV set's able to pick it up.	CDR
27359	199210	There are some bright spots shining on the probe. Apparently Sun shafting on it that just gets just about enough for us to make it out. Over.	CC
27360	199221	I think those are the tunnel lights.	CDR
27361	199222	...	SC
27362	199224	Oh, Okay. You're right.	CC
27363	199232	Okay. It's loose now. Coming down.	CDR
27364	199235	Roger.	CC
27365	199257	Looks like it's a little bit easier than doing that in the chamber.	CC
27366	199264	You bet. This is the only way ...	CDR
27367	199265	You have to take it easy.	CMP
27368	199266	It's pretty massive, but it goes where you direct it.	CDR
27369	199271	11, Houston. That's a beautiful picture now, we've got. We're looking at a 12-second delay. To us you are just bringing it down by the optics now.	CC
27370	199287	Mike must have done a smooth job in that docking. There isn't a dent or a mark on the probe.	CDR
27371	199293	Roger.	CC
27372	199298	We're really getting a great picture here, 11. Over.	CC
27373	199320	11, Houston. With a 12-foot cable, we estimate you should have about 5 to 6 feet excess when you get the camera into the LM. Over.	CC
27374	199331	Roger.	CDR
27375	199334	We can see the probe now. Correction, the drogue.	CC
27376	199342	Roger.	CDR
27377	199384	Okay. Drogue removal's coming next.	CDR
27378	199386	Roger. As we suspected.	CC
27379	199447	11, Houston. Now it's a good view of the storage area under the couch.	CC
27380	199475	11, Houston. Looks like you're pretty crowded in there with that drogue. Over.	CC
27381	199483	Oh, it's not really bad.	CDR
27382	199484	This TV cable is getting in the way.	CMP
27383	199494	We see lots of arms.	CC
27384	199520	The only problem, Charlie, is these TV stagehands don't know where they stand.	LMP
27385	199527	Well, you got to really have a union card, there. We can't really complain too much, I guess.	CC
27386	199588	Apollo 11, Houston. Do you have a little white dot in the bottom of your monitor - TV monitor? Over.	CC
27387	199599	Roger. We do.	LMP
27388	199601	Roger. I guess part of the camera's been burnt out down there. These are really beautiful pictures now, Buzz. Over. Real clear.	CC
27389	199616	Okay. We might have got just a little bit of Sun in there. Is it just one small white dot?	LMP
27390	199621	That's affirmative.	CC
27391	199662	We went up in the tunnel checking the roll angle, Charlie, and it's 2.05 degrees.	CMP
27392	199668	Roger. Copy. 2.05 on the roll CAL.	CC
27393	199675	And that's a plus.	CMP
27394	199677	Roger. Plus.	CC
27395	199725	11, Houston. The tunnel looks pretty clear to us. Somebody going up there now. Over.	CC
27396	199733	It's Mike checking his connectors up there now.	CDR
27397	199740	Roger.	CC
27398	199748	11, Houston. The lighting up in there looks very good to us at this time. Over.	CC
27399	199762	I think that's mostly the camera. It - it's subdued to say the least.	CDR
27400	199770	Roger. It's pretty - It's gathering pretty well to us. We see everything quite clearly up in there.	CC
27401	199805	Well, the docking latches look good today just like they did yesterday. Everything up in there looks just fine.	CMP
27402	199812	That sounds fine to us. Over.	CC
27403	199845	11, Houston. We can even read the decals up there on the LM hatch.	CC
27404	199853	Well, let me zoom it up and see how much you can read.	LMP
27405	199857	Okay.	CC
27406	199871	We can see the LM umbilical connection quite well there, Buzz. We see you zooming in on one of the decals now. It's, "To reset, unlatch handle; latch behind grip and pull back two full strokes." That's about all we can make out.	CC
27407	199895	Hey, you get an A-plus.	LMP
27408	199897	Thank you very much, sir. At least I passed my eye test.	CC
27409	199906	I'm standing 6 feet from it, Charlie, and you can read it better than I can. There's something wrong with the system.	LMP
27410	199914	Roger.	CC
27411	199988	That's a real good view of the LM hatch handle there, 11. 0ver.	CC
27412	199996	Roger.	CDR
27413	200004	Looks like we'll be ready to go into the LM early if that's okay with you all down there.	CDR
27414	200014	Roger. It's fine with us, Neil. Go ahead anytime you wish. Over.	CC
27415	200037	11, Houston. The white spot you see on your monitor, our TV people say it is a burn spot; but they expect it to dissipate after a couple of hours. Over.	CC
27416	200054	Roger. Thank you.	LMP
27417	200123	Okay, the dump valve is actuated.	CMP
27418	200126	Roger. Copy, 11. We see that very clearly. Is that you, Buzz, with your hand on it?	CC
27419	200133	Yes.	CMP
27420	200134	Roger.	LMP
27421	200170	11, Houston. We're really amazed at the quality of the picture up in the tunnel. It's really superb. Over.	CC
27422	200178	It is, considering the amount of light up in there.	LMP
27423	200180	Roger. We're about to open our hatch now.	CMP
27424	200183	Roger.	CC
27425	200192	Roger. There's that same guy that, when you open up the door, why, he's waiting there for you, and he turns the lights on.	CMP
27426	200198	How about that. Just like the refrigerator.	CC
27427	200228	Buzz, the view in through your - by your right - left shoulder there is so good we can see the ascent engine cover, the Velcro on it, and that's about all we can make out right now.	CC
27428	200247	Now we can see the helmet stowage bag - -	CC
27429	200248	We don't see anything loose up there.	LMP
27430	200250	Well, great. Looks good to us. We see the helmet storage bag.	CC
27431	200273	Hello, 11. Houston. We got a view of the PLSS there, off the right of our screen.	CC
27432	200315	11, Houston. Buzz, you already in? Over.	CC
27433	200322	Roger. I'm halfway in, hanging out. Start turning around, I guess.	LMP
27434	200326	Roger.	CC
27435	200354	Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like you to read out the LCG reservoir sight level. Over.	CC
27436	200367	Okay. Stand by.	CMP
27437	200390	11, we have a good view of the window there. It looks like the Sun's finally coming through the shade.	CC
27438	200400	Yes, I'm afraid it's - We're just about plus Z toward the Sun.	LMP
27439	200405	That's affirmative. This attitude put both windows right toward the Sun - or the LM. Over.	CC
27440	200415	Well, that may be good in some respects, but -	LMP
27441	200422	We had a view, Buzz, of the utility light cord. ...	CC
27442	200431	Now let me show you a view looking the other way.	LMP
27443	200433	Roger. And we see right now the utility light or either the floodlight up there.	CC
27444	200445	I think now I see the utility light still in the stowage bag. Hey, that's a great shot right there. We see you in there. Guess that's Neil and Mike. Better be, anyway.	CC
27445	200473	We see you waving.	CC
27446	200493	11, Houston. That's really a beautiful shot.	CC
27447	200506	11, Houston. We didn't quite decipher that signal that just came from the CMP.	CC
27448	200515	Just saying hello. On the LCG sight gage, you got about - oh, it looks like the white mark that's in the plunger is about a quarter to three-eighths inch out into the green away from the red. Is that what you'd like to see? Over.	LMP
27449	200538	Stand by. Roger, Buzz. That looks good to us. Thank you much.	CC
27450	200548	It is the white index, is it not, that you're interested in comparing whether it's in the red or green?	LMP
27451	200554	Stand by. That's affirmative, Buzz. It looks good. That's a good reading for us. Over.	CC
27452	200562	Okay.	LMP
27453	200566	We had a shot moment - a moment ago of the suit disconnect valve.	CC
27454	200578	I'll open up the windows and see what the lighting condition's going to be like.	LMP
27455	200604	11, Houston. That's a real good view we have of the AOT. You're back now, Buzz, and notice you're taking down one of the window shades. Over.	CC
27456	200616	The light is superb.	CC
27457	200617	How's the Sun coming in? How's the Sun coming in from this direction going to affect what you can see?	LMP
27458	200624	It made it really super. The lighting is excellent in the - in the LM right now. We can make out the AOT, the ISA, and the left-hand window - there's a little glare off of that, but the LMPside the - with the shade down it's really excellent. Over.	CC
27459	200648	Well, let's - I'm turned around, why I took the shade off my side first.	LMP
27460	200656	Roger. We copy. The light level for the TV is really excellent. Over.	CC
27461	200669	Yes, the lighting in the LM is very nice now, just like completely daylight; and everything is visible. A good bit lighter than the tunnel was earlier.	CDR
27462	200683	Roger. We got a good view now, Neil, of the DEDA; and also Buzz's ACA.	CC
27463	200705	Hey, I'm pointing it at the front hatch now. Everything seems to be in place down there.	LMP
27464	200711	Roger, we got the dump valves in view. Over.	CC
27465	200713	Roger.	LMP
27466	200744	11, Houston. We see you removing the ISA now, folding it up, putting it up on the AOT. The instrument panels are coming into view behind.	CC
27467	200758	Yes, I think it'd probably be best, since we've done SPS burn, to put it back over the instrument panel instead of putting it up over the PLSS on the recharge station. Would you care to comment on that one? We could do either just as easily.	LMP
27468	200772	Stand by. We'll have an answer for you momentarily.	CC
27469	200778	11, Houston. That's really a super shot of the main display.	CC
27470	200819	The vehicle is surprisingly free of any debris floating around. It's very clean.	LMP
27471	200824	Roger.	CC
27472	200837	11, Houston. It's pretty hard to describe this view. It's really - really great.	CC
27473	200843	Now you know how we feel.	LMP
27474	200850	Okay. Neil's OPS is about 57, 5800.	LMP
27475	200855	Copy.	CC
27476	200856	And mine's about 5800, also.	LMP
27477	200859	Copy.	CC
27478	200884	11, Houston. That's a good shot of Neil's PLSS, there. Over.	CC
27479	200896	No, that's mine.	LMP
27480	200920	11, Houston. That moment - a moment ago, we had a good shot of your PLSS, Buzz, and the two helmet stowage bags. Down behind your left shoulder, Buzz, we have the - the DSKY and the ACA.	CC
27481	201001	We're going to go ahead and take all the Moon data on back into the command module, Charlie.	LMP
27482	201007	Roger.	CC
27483	201058	Apollo 11, Houston. Buzz, it appears that you're intending to put on the Sun filter and view the Sun through the AOT. Over.	CC
27484	201069	Yes, unfortunately it looks like it's down a little bit more towards ... than I can be able to see in the AOT.	LMP
27485	201077	Roger.	CC
27486	201135	We got a beautiful view of the side of the command module out of the AOT looking in the left rear detent.	LMP
27487	201143	Roger.	CC
27488	201144	I can see the hatch and all the - all the EVA handrails. First time we've seen the silvery outside of the command module.	LMP
27489	201160	I can read the letters on the hatch cover. It's a boost cover release; and the big yellow arrow that points toward the opening - place where the tool B goes.	LMP
27490	201175	Roger. Great shot now back down into the -	CC
27491	201181	And left on the - -	CMP
27492	201184	Go ahead, Buzz. Over.	CC
27493	201187	Say again.	LMP
27494	201188	I was just saying we got a great shot looking back into the command module.	CC
27495	201194	Okay. And the left detent, I can see the AO - or the rendezvous radar, and I move to the forward detent and that's about all I've got. I'm looking eyeball to eyeball.	LMP
27496	201205	Roger.	CC
27497	201248	Charlie, is there any concern about the duration that we ought to have the window shades open?	LMP
27498	201254	Stand by.	CC
27499	201257	We don't have - We don't have any circulation in here, and it might get a little on the warm side.	LMP
27500	201263	Roger.	CC
27501	201270	We'll - We'll put up a couple of hoses in the command module here and get a little circulation going.	CMP
27502	201276	Sounds like a good idea. Over.	CC
27503	201304	Apollo 11, Houston. As far as the window shades go in this LM, there's nothing except for crew comfort. I don't think we've got any systems problem. Be sure to put them back up when you egress. Over.	CC
27504	201317	That we will do.	LMP
27505	201352	Charlie, I'll give you a view out of the overhead window, back looking at the command module right-hand rendezvous window.	LMP
27506	201361	Roger.	CC
27507	201379	Well, we see it now. Thanks a lot, Buzz. That's a good view through the overhead.	CC
27508	201392	One washer on -	LMP
27509	201398	One washer's on by the overhead.	LMP
27510	201402	Roger.	CC
27511	201409	There we go. We got it now.	CC
27512	201418	There wasn't very much debris in the command module or the LM. We found very few loose particles of bolts, nuts, and screws and lint and things. Very few in each spacecraft. They were very clean.	LMP
27513	201434	Roger. Sounds good.	CC
27514	201465	11, Houston. We have a good view out of the rendezvous - correction, the overhead window of the LM. We don't see anybody staring back at us, though. Over.	CC
27515	201543	Charlie, can you see Mike's two eyeballs staring out through the rendezvous window?	LMP
27516	201551	11, Houston. Stand by. We haven't picked him up yet.	CC
27517	201562	You are looking through a lot of layers of glass.	LMP
27518	201578	11, Houston. We had a - -	CC
27519	201580	... on my monitor.	LMP
27520	201581	We had a slight glimpse of Mike in the rendezvous window at that time. It's pretty murky looking into there, though.	CC
27521	201588	Okay. Here he is; I've got him. I've got, him on the monitor now.	LMP
27522	201595	Okay. We see him staring back at us now. Hello, in there.	CC
27523	201628	Apollo 11, Houston. Our recommendation for the ISA is to stow it back over the instrument panel. Over.	CC
27524	201642	Roger. Will do.	LMP
27525	201716	11, Houston. We can make out the markings on the panel. We read SYSTEM A ASCENT FUEL, ASCENT OXIDIZER. Quad 1, quad 4. The - It's really unbelievable, the definition we're getting down here off that little camera. Over.	CC
27526	201734	We can even see the barber pole on the talkbacks.	CC
27527	201744	We can read the markings on the instruments for the glycol pressure, quantity, PCO2. You can even read the scale on the eight ball. Over.	CC
27528	201778	11, Houston. We see the cross-feed barber pole, and we have the Velcro patches back up to the RCS systems now. We can see the markings on the meters, green and red bands, in limits.	CC
27529	201807	We see you raised the cover on the abort stage. We don't recommend that.	CC
27530	201814	Yes. We're going to tape that one over.	LMP
27531	201815	Roger.	CC
27532	201816	We're going to tape that one over.	LMP
27533	201817	We concur.	CC
27534	201824	The restraints in here do a pretty good job of pulling my pants down.	LMP
27535	201833	Roger. We haven't quite got that before the 50,000,000 TV audience, yet.	CC
27536	201857	11, Houston. That's a good view of the eight ball. We see - You can even read the OFF flag, there.	CC
27537	201870	You can see the signal strength meter for the radar, read the numbers on it.	CC
27538	201894	Houston, did you want us to test the cameras in the LM and - I was wondering about that. I saw it in the flight plan, but I'm just wondering if you want to do that on CSM power, or do you want us to take both of the 16mm cameras back in the CSM and test them there? Over.	LMP
27539	201918	Stand by, Buzz.	CC
27540	201921	As an alternative to that, why, we could wait LOI day and do it then when we transfer over to LM power.	LMP
27541	201932	Roger. Stand by. We'll have an answer.	CC
27542	201947	11, Houston. On that TV, our commentary - The monitor I was looking at was delayed about 12 seconds, 12 to 15 seconds while it went through our color converter. It was probably - You thought I was crazy, but we were looking at it 15 seconds after you broadcast it. 11, Houston - -	CC
27543	201966	We understood that, Charlie.	LMP
27544	201968	Okay. On the LM cameras, we'd like you to do it on LOI day with the LM power. Over.	CC
27545	201979	Okay. That's what we'll do.	LMP
27546	202036	Houston, we're showing you something that came out of the Commander's checklist stowage packet. It's got a 16-millimeter camera in it, and it's got this little cylinder; and I guess - I don't understand what it is. Maybe you can tell us.	LMP
27547	202055	Roger. Stand by. We can't figure it out either.	CC
27548	202066	It's got an arrow on the back, and it says "turn," but I'm afraid to turn it.	LMP
27549	202076	11, your friendly geologist says it's the camera cank- crank, excuse me, for the 16-sequence camera if it jams. Over.	CC
27550	202090	All very well. Thank you.	LMP
27551	202108	There's that word again. The ancillary stowage container.	LMP
27552	202115	Roger.	CC
27553	202150	The shades couldn't quite hack it, there, Buzz. Over.	CC
27554	202191	Houston, 11. Are you still getting high bit rate off the OMNI's at this distance?	CMP
27555	202196	Stand by, Mike.	CC
27556	202207	Apollo 11, Houston. About 50 percent of the time, we're getting high bit rate off the OMNI's when you're in PTC. Over.	CC
27557	202217	Okay. Thank you.	CMP
27558	202219	You're welcome.	CC
27559	202284	Apollo 11, Houston. Neil, at this attitude you look like you're about 12 feet long.	CC
27560	202294	It seems like I always find myself upside-down in whatever I'm doing around here.	CDR
27561	202349	Apollo 11, Houston. Could you give us a few comments on your crew comfort with the CSM hoses moving the air around? Over.	CC
27562	202362	Well, it's picking up a little bit on circulation in here.	LMP
27563	202367	What do you estimate the temperature is, Buzz? Over.	CC
27564	202377	Oh, I'd say maybe 73, 75.	LMP
27565	202382	Roger.	CC
27566	202386	It's hard to tell at this density and pressure of gas, but comfort level is about the - about the same as the command module.	LMP
27567	202400	You probably - -	CC
27568	202401	It was a little warmer or stuffier when we first got in, but it seems to be improving.	LMP
27569	202407	Houston copies. Out.	CC
27570	202468	11, Houston.	CC
27571	202469	You may be able to see some - -	LMP
27572	202471	Go ahead.	CC
27573	202472	- - some particles jumping around on your screen. That's just dust particles that are being illuminated by Sun shafting in the window.	LMP
27574	202482	Roger. They're very clear now. Over. And that's a good view of Neil's - correction, of Buzz's circuit breaker panel, there.	CC
27575	202550	I can just barely see the handrail on the front porch from the position on the right-hand window.	LMP
27576	202559	Roger.	CC
27577	202575	11, Houston. Our view of the Panel 11 is - gets brighter, then darker. Are you changing the f-stop at all? Over.	CC
27578	202592	No, what's happening is, we get pretty close to the window now and then, and it drives the automatic light control into the stop, I think.	LMP
27579	202602	I think that's right.	CC
27580	202611	Yes, I had the switch on OUTSIDE while I was going through the overhead window. That may be what's contributing to some of it.	LMP
27581	202618	Roger.	CC
27582	202625	11, Houston. We seem to be picking up a few more dust particles now. We see them quite clearly in the screen now. Over.	CC
27583	202637	Yes, I'm choking on one every so often.	LMP
27584	202661	11, Houston. Your show is going out to the U.S. now. We're about to get the satellite up. It'll be transmitted to some other countries after that. Over.	CC
27585	202678	Roger. I'm checking out this window bracket where I'll be putting it for the EVA pictures of Neil going down the ladder.	LMP
27586	202688	Roger.	CC
27587	202697	Apollo 11, Houston. We keep marveling about the color and the clarity of the picture. It's really difficult to describe. It's - It's just perfect. Over.	CC
27588	202711	And, 11, it doesn't look like you're having too much trouble with that bracket up there, Buzz.	CC
27589	202721	I'll tell you, those new knobs really make it easy to twist the thing and get it cinched down quite tight.	LMP
27590	202730	Roger.	CC
27591	202806	11, Houston. Buzz, how does the alignment look, there?	CC
27592	202813	It looks pretty good, as well as I can tell without the gear extended. I can't get a real definitive answer, but you couldn't fix it any place to see much more out of the window without hand-holding it for the whole time.	LMP
27593	202829	Roger. Looks like to us it's going to work real well.	CC
27594	202831	Give it enough room to - Yes, I think so.	LMP
27595	202862	Buzz, we see you putting your window guard in place there, and back up to the ISA now.	CC
27596	202919	Houston, ask FAO if the 90-degree bracket isn't stowed in the Commander's stowage assembly.	LMP
27597	202929	Stand by.	CC
27598	203015	11, Houston. Buzz, you still looking for that 90-degree bracket? Over.	CC
27599	203025	Yes, he is looking for it now.	CDR
27600	203027	Roger. We'll have a word for you in just a moment.	CC
27601	203068	Our monitor shows pretty good, clear pictures from this angle. I already found the 90-degree bracket.	CDR
27602	203077	Roger, Neil. It's really a super picture. We've got the ACA, your ACA, the picture of the throttle, the 90-degree bracket. We see your handles, and now over to the bracket.	CC
27603	203125	That's about the position we'll be putting the camera in after the initial descent on the ladder, and it'll be taken 1 frame a second for most of the EVA.	LMP
27604	203140	Houston copies. Out. That's a real good view of that camera.	CC
27605	203163	Our monitor is a little bit wavy, so it's hard for us to tell when we're - when we've got a steady picture for you.	LMP
27606	203171	11, we have no complaints at all. We don't see that waviness on our picture. It's just really great. Over.	CC
27607	203179	Do the edges of the window look like straight lines to you?	LMP
27608	203182	That's affirmative.	CC
27609	203186	Okay. They don't in our monitor, and that leads us to make some corrections to the camera, which probably aren't required sometimes.	LMP
27610	203199	Buzz, we have no complaints at all. It's a magnificent picture.	CC
27611	203269	What was that, Buzz, you're chasing now?	CC
27612	203275	That was - That was me picking up some particles of paint that were floating through the air in front of the camera, there.	CDR
27613	203282	Roger, Neil. We got it. It appears to us that Neil's about to check the Velcro mat, there.	CC
27614	203297	Okay, Buzz. We see the card up now.	CC
27615	203306	Okay. For those of you that don't know, this is where we log most of our data for each of the LM maneuvers, and we have another card like this that the timeline book that is laid down on the table in front of the data display keyboard; and it's on this timeline that we have all our procedures. But we obviously have to hold these in place in zero g, so we make use of the Velcro patches on the back and on the table so we can attach these down here; and then we just turn the pages over when we go to new sequences in our timeline of procedures.	LMP
27616	203353	Roger.	CC
27617	203358	And we're ready to copy DOI PAD.	LMP
27618	203361	Roger. We'll have the FIDO's work that one up for you momentarily.	CC
27619	203426	11, Houston. That was a good shot of Panel 2. Now we got Panel 3 in view with the TEMP MONITOR switch. The stabilization - station and control panel, we see now, with the MODE CONTROL switches. Now over to the rendezvous radar. Real good.	CC
27620	203448	11, that's real good camera work.	CC
27621	203466	That'll be the most unusual position a cameraman's ever had, hanging by his toes from a tunnel and taking the picture upside-down.	LMP
27622	203477	Roger. Well you're doing a super job. We got a good view of the cross pointer, there. Had a good view of the tape meter.	CC
27623	203501	We're giving you a picture now of the floor of the cabin. I think you can see the - one of the two portable life support system backpacks here in the center, and on each side, we have the two helmet visors. I'll remove one of them and show you a little closer view of what this looks like.	LMP
27624	203524	Roger.	CC
27625	203530	Inside the helmet visors are the EVA gloves with the blue tips. I'm about to take those out now.	LMP
27626	203547	Roger, Buzz. That's a great shot now that we're getting of the helmet, the EVA visor, and also the - the EVA gloves in the background.	CC
27627	203561	Okay. You did say this was going out now, didn't you?	LMP
27628	203565	Standby. I think so.	CC
27629	203578	11, you got a pretty big audience. It's live in the U.S. It's going live to Japan, western Europe, and much of South America. Everybody reports very good color. Appreciate the great show.	CC
27630	203595	Roger. Understand. Thank you.	LMP
27631	203628	Buzz, that was a good demonstration of your EVA visor assembly. Appreciate it.	CC
27632	203679	Hey, I like the good view of Mr. Collins down there. We finally see him again.	CC
27633	203686	Hello there, earthling. 02 08 34 54 CCHello there.	CMP
27634	203724	11, Houston. We noticed when you were scanning over Panel 2 a moment ago, 1 and 2, the two eight balls were slightly in disagreement. Control said he'd like a AGS align, there.	CC
27635	203739	Yes. One of them's AGS, one of them's PNGCS. The problem is, we don't know whether to align AGS to PNGCS or PNGCS to AGS.	LMP
27636	203751	Stand by.	CC
27637	203758	11, Chris said he can tell you.	CC
27638	203765	We'll cage them both.	LMP
27639	203768	Roger.	CC
27640	203821	Like old home week, Charlie, to get back in the LM again.	LMP
27641	203824	Roger. I can imagine.	CC
27642	203844	The traverse from the bottom of the LM to the aft bulkhead of the command module must be about 16, 20 feet. It's not a disorienting one at all, but it's most interesting to contemplate just pushing off from one and bounding on into the other vehicle all the way through the tunnel.	CDR
27643	203864	Roger. Must be some experience. Is Collins going to go in and look around?	CC
27644	203876	We're willing to let him go but he hasn't come up with the price of the ticket yet.	CDR
27645	203888	If I can get him to keep his hands off my DSKY, it'd be a fair swap.	CDR
27646	203893	Roger.	CC
27647	203898	That's why I've been eating so much today. I haven't had anything to do. He won't let me touch it any more.	CMP
27648	203903	Roger.	CC
27649	203935	11, Houston. If that's not the Earth, we're in trouble.	CC
27650	203940	That's the Earth, and we have a very good view of it today. There are a few more cloud bands on than yesterday when we beamed down to you, but it's a beautiful sight.	CDR
27651	203974	We have some horizontal banding in our TV monitor. Are we transmitting that to you, or do you have a clear picture?	CDR
27652	203981	Neil, we have a very clear picture. The only thing that we see is a little white dot in the bottom of our screen, which is - our TV guys say is an - apparently a burned out spot in the camera, but it should come back. Over.	CC
27653	203999	Roger. We have that in our monitor also.	CDR
27654	204020	11, Houston. We do have three lines across our TV. I thought it was just a transmission problem, but everybody's telling me now that it's probably - it's on the downlink. Over.	CC
27655	204035	No, those are the same three ones that we have.	CDR
27656	204037	Okay.	CC
27657	204047	How far are - out are we now, Charlie?	LMP
27658	204051	Stand by. Give you exact figure.	CC
27659	204060	Did you notice the difference between yesterday and today? This is as large an image we can - we can give you.	CDR
27660	204065	Roger. If you think we're smaller, you're now 177,000 miles out. Over.	CC
27661	204073	Thank you.	LMP
27662	204074	That's nautical miles?	CDR
27663	204077	That's affirmative, 11. We -	CC
27664	204083	... Hold on.	LMP
27665	204084	Go ahead. Over.	CC
27666	204094	11, Houston. We see the - still see the banding along the intratropical convergence. I guess the most predominate one now is around the - up in the - around the equator or slightly north of the equator.	CC
27667	204111	Yes, that's the way it looks, Charlie. Same as yesterday.	LMP
27668	204114	Roger.	CC
27669	204125	Just keep the Pacific Ocean nice and clear and calm on splash day, is all we ask.	LMP
27670	204151	And Charlie, I'd like to say hello to all my fellow scouts and scouters at Farragut State Park in Idaho having a National Jamboree there this week; and Apollo 11 would like to send them best wishes.	CDR
27671	204167	Thank you, Apollo 11. I'm sure that, if they didn't hear that, they'll get the word through the news, surely appreciate that.	CC
27672	204212	11, Houston. We have you - your subspacecraft point is just off the western coast of South America directly south of about Mexico City. Over.	CC
27673	204226	That - That looks like what we observe from here.	CDR
27674	204242	And we're going to turn our TV monitor off now for a short bit while we have some other work to do. Apollo 11 signing off.	CDR
27675	204252	Roger, 11. Thank you very much. That was one of the greatest shows we've ever seen. We sure appreciate it. Over.	CC
27676	204260	It was a pleasure.	CDR
27677	204350	Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Could you give us an idea of about how long it will be before you start close - closing the LM back up? Over.	CC
27678	204360	We've got a little more work to do up here, Charlie. We're going to make sure that we have everything transferred around and stowed the way we want it and try to get a little bit ahead on tomorrow's timeline. I suppose that we could be out of there in another half hour or so if it was necessary.	CDR
27679	204383	Roger, Neil. We're not trying to push you. We're just trying to get an idea of - about water dumps and starting up the PTC again. Take your sweet time. Over.	CC
27680	204394	Okay. We'd like to get a flight plan update from you for the next couple of hours, here. When you think what the various constraints might be and what - what order you might like us to do things.	CDR
27681	204413	Roger. Stand by. We'll have that to you in a moment.	CC
27682	204968	Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Mike, we'd like to go ahead and do a waste-water dump. We'd like you to dump it all the way down to zero. Over.	CC
27683	204981	Roger. We copy that, Charlie.	CMP
27684	204991	How does that work, Charlie?	CMP
27685	205046	Houston, 11.	CDR
27686	205084	11, Houston. Did you call? Over.	CC
27687	205089	Roger. Just noticed that the mast that the EVA light is on is charred brown. It looks as though it took quite a beating during launch.	CDR
27688	205103	Roger.	CC
27689	205104	The EVA light still does work.	CDR
27690	205107	Roger. We'll let this - the SPAN guys look at this, and we'll be back with you with what we think. Over.	CC
27691	205117	Okay.	CDR
27692	205221	11, Houston. We were wondering, Neil, with your closing comment on the TV, if you were going to turn it off. It indicated that you might be considering turning it back on. We were wondering whether we want to keep the lines up. Over.	CC
27693	205235	Well, we want your recommendation on that, but I think we would just as soon, ourselves, terminate the TV. But if you have a commitment to keep, we'd be more than willing to turn it back on.	CDR
27694	205252	Roger. Stand by.	CC
27695	205285	Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like to terminate the TV. We don't - We think we got a really - a good tape. That hour and a half show was superb. And we'd like to pick up TV - correction - PTC at about 58 hours. Over.	CC
27696	205304	Roger. PTC at 58 hours.	CDR
27697	205308	And we'll have the remaining functions in the flight plan soon. Over.	CC
27698	205316	Okay. Fine.	CDR
27699	205445	Apollo 11, Houston. Our recommendations on the activities for the next hour or so, as far as flight plan goes, are: Continue your LM familiarization as desired until about 58 hours, then ingress to the CSM, close the hatch, and establish PTC shortly thereafter. Over.	CC
27700	205467	And, Apollo 11, Houston. Terminate the - -	CC
27701	205469	Okay.	LMP
27702	205470	- - the water dump. Over.	CC
27703	205471	Okay, Charlie. Thank you.	LMP
27704	205474	Okay. Water dump being terminated now.	LMP
27705	206268	Houston, Apollo 11.	CMP
27706	206271	11, Houston. Go ahead.	CC
27707	206275	Roger, Houston. I'd like to do a P52 option 3 and tweak the platform up prior to starting the PTC. Over.	CMP
27708	206283	Roger, 11. Stand by.	CC
27709	206294	11, Houston. That sounds like a good idea to us. Go ahead.	CC
27710	206300	Okay. And the platform's looking pretty good to me. It looks like the worst axis drift is 0.01 something degrees per hour. Is that about what you figure?	CMP
27711	206307	11, Roger. We've had reports all the marks have been good all the - the last couple of times you've run them. Just a moment; I'll get you some	CC
27712	206321	Okay, Owen. Thank you. You got the maroons on?	CMP
27713	206327	Say again, 11.	CC
27714	206331	I say you got the maroons on now?	CMP
27715	206334	Not permanently, Mike. Just have a stand-by here while Charlie's out checking how to use that special tool on the camera. The maroon team will be on tomorrow.	CC
27716	206346	Okay. Nice to hear your voice. How's everything going?	CMP
27717	206349	Everything's going smoothly here. We sure enjoyed the show this afternoon, Mike.	CC
27718	206355	Okay.	CMP
27719	206367	11, Houston. We suggest you go ahead and do the P52 first, and we'll take a look at the angles and give you some new drift rates after taking a look at them. Over.	CC
27720	206377	All right. Fair enough.	CMP
27721	206700	Apollo 11, Houston. Over.	CC
27722	206705	Go ahead. 11, here.	CDR
27723	206707	11, Houston. A little information to you there, CDR. We've all taken a momentary brief respite from out work here to have some special - to have a bite of special moon cheese that is - I understand it's been sent to us directly from Wapakoneta, your own hometown. Over.	CC
27724	206729	No, we can't - we can't pronounce it either. I think you'll enjoy that. They make a fine brand of cheese.	CDR
27725	206737	Roger, there, and I'll polish up the grammar for the next trip.	CC
27726	206750	Houston, 11. You are looking at the NOUN 93, and I'll proceed when you copy them.	CMP
27727	206760	11, Houston. We've got them.	CC
27728	206768	Okay.	CMP

27766	211282	Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We have some updates and some things we'd like to talk to you about, if you aren't in the middle of your meal. If it's convenient anytime for you, we're ready with some updates. Over.	CC
27767	211306	What - What are the updates going to apply to?	CDR
27768	211311	Roger. We have a couple of changes on the LM mission rules NO GO for your NO GO card, Neil. One slight change on the APS/DPS fuel and TEMP pressure card, and we have a change to the procedure for the secondary radiator leak check, which is to be formed at - performed at 71 hours tomorrow, and also some indications that we have a couple of landing site obliques stowed in the wrong place. Over.	CC
27769	211356	Okay. Is any of those in the flight plan? The secondary radiator, for example?	CDR
27770	211363	That's affirmative. The secondary radiator leak check is called out in the flight plan at 71 20. That procedure is listed in your launch operations book on page 2 9, L2 9. We'd like to change that procedure. Over.	CC
27771	211388	Okay. Stand by.	CDR
27772	211405	Charlie, on the secondary leak check, just read it verbatim like you want, and I'll copy directly into the flight plan and not fool around with the checklist.	CMP
27773	211412	Roger. That's fine. If you're ready to copy, stand by.	CC
27774	211417	Ready to copy on the leak check.	CMP
27775	211420	Roger. It's monitor secondary accumulator quantity. Step 2 is secondary glycol to radiator valve, NORMAL for 30 seconds, then BYPASS. If no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity - Are you with me?	CC
27776	211461	Yes, I'm with you.	CMP
27777	211462	Okay. If no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity, secondary glycol to radiator valve to NORMAL. Next step, secondary coolant loop pump,	CC
27778	211552	Okay. I read back: monitor secondary accumulator quantity; secondary glycol radiator valve, NORMAL for 30 seconds, then to BYPASS. If no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity, secondary glycol to radiator valve to NORMAL. Secondary coolant loop pump, AC 1 or 2. After 3 minutes, verify glycol secondary discharge pressure 39 to 51 psig. Verify secondary evaporator outlet TEMP has changed. Secondary coolant loop pump, OFF. Secondary glycol radiator valve to BYPASS. And what's the reason for the change, Charlie?	CMP
27779	211587	Roger. Stan is concerned that our present procedure as shown in the checklist does not really flow glycol through the radiator, and it - They want to verify that we do not have a plugged secondary radiator. Over.	CC
27780	211608	Okay. They have any abnormal indications in that system, so far?	CMP
27781	211612	Negative. This is the procedure that they came up with. It's just a check, Mike. Everything's looking great to us. Over.	CC
27782	211622	Okay. Fine.	CMP
27783	211651	Charlie, we'll get back with you on these other changes in a few minutes. Okay?	CDR
27784	211658	Roger, Neil. No hurry. Over.	CC
27785	213057	11, Houston. We're wondering who's on horn.	CC
27786	213069	Say again, Houston?	CMP
27787	213072	We just had a little music there.	CC
27788	213081	We'll keep you entertained.	CMP
27789	213088	Roger. That was good. You can keep it coming down, 11.	CC
27790	213096	Okay.	CMP
27791	213154	Because it's a special occasion today, Houston. This is the third anniversary of Gemini 10.	CMP
27792	213162	Roger. Happy anniversary.	CC
27793	213171	Thank you, sir.	CMP
27794	213572	Houston, Apollo 11. Ready to copy your update.	LMP
27795	213575	Roger. Stand by.	CC
27796	213590	Okay, Buzz. The first item is that we have indications that your landing site obliques are not in the proper position. If you'll check, we think that the intermediate scale landing site oblique is stowed in the CSM lunar landmark book. We think that the large scale landing site oblique is stowed in the back of the LM lunar surface map book. Over.	CC
27797	213638	I think I heard you Charlie, but I'm not sure that I understand.	LMP
27798	213645	Roger. According to our stowage list the - the landing site oblique should be in the transfer bag. In - But in the backup set of data, the intermediate scale oblique is in the CSM lunar landmark book, and the large scale oblique is in the back of the LM lunar surface map book; and that's the reason we think that they might be not where you think they are. Over.	CC
27799	213675	Okay. We've got three obliques. The last one is one I asked for recently. It's just a blow up of the second one. The first one is one that's got dotted lines on it, indicating horizon view and 50-degree LPD; and all three of those are in the transfer book. Over.	LMP
27800	213694	Roger. Fine. We were wrong in our - in our backup set. We had those out of place. Looks like the onboard data's good. We just wanted to let you check on that one. We have an update on the APS/DPS fuel card that you place on the panel. It's a typo error. If you'll break out that little card, we've got the - correct that typo error. Over.	CC
27801	213730	Stand by.	LMP
27802	213785	Okay. I got it.	LMP
27803	213787	Roger, Buzz. Under the DPS column on the pressure side, you go down to the fourth item, says pressure greater than 150 PTCA should be greater than 65 percent. Over.	CC
27804	213808	Okay. That's greater than 1.8 but less than 65 and greater than 150 for greater than 65.	LMP
27805	213815	That's affirmative. Out.	CC
27806	213826	And we have three items on the mission rules NO-GO card, if you're ready to copy those. Over.	CC
27807	213872	Okay. I've got the mission rules NO-GO.	LMP
27808	213920	Okay. I've got that: AC bus A for DOI and both buses NO-GO for PDI on.	LMP
27809	213928	That's affirmative up until high gate. You can stop at the line in front of the column "5 minutes to low gate". Now the next line is under the G&C PGNS, pitch and roll GDA's. You can scratch that line completely. Over.	CC
27810	213956	Roger. Got it.	LMP
27811	213957	Okay, Buzz. Last entry is down under RCS, and it's a typo error under the three - in the line "three axis attitude control". If you proceed to the right at PDI plus 05, you'll see one axis. The line goes all the way to low gate to touchdown. That's incorrect. The line should stop under "5 minutes to low gate". Over.	CC
27812	213998	Okay. We're stopping that at "5 minutes to low gate".	LMP
27813	214001	That's affirmative. That completes that card. The rest of the updates are just really for your information based on our 58 hour platform - look at the platform. We are really good shape. Your GYRO's have almost no drift in them since - plotted update we were looking at X of a minus 2.24 ...	CC
27814	214341	This is Apollo 11. Radio check.	CDR
27815	214343	Roger. Reading you five by. How me? Over.	CC
27816	214348	Okay. Loud and clear. You cut out when you were talking about the platform - something about 52 hours and after that, we never heard you again.	CDR
27817	214357	Roger. Guess we were changing antennas. Stand by. That's affirmative, 11. We were swapping antennas on you down here. Basically the word is that we have a real good platform, very small drift on the GYRO's, and very small drift in the PIPA's. Over.	CC
27818	214380	Roger. Thank you. And I would like to have a few words of clarification if you will give them to me on the RCS ... what that change of pitch may mean.	CDR
27819	214394	Copy. A few words of clarification on the RCS? Oh. Roger. The update there, Neil, you are speaking of about the one axis down to 5 minutes of low gate?	CC
27820	214411	Yes. That's right. I'm not quite sure what that ... means beyond 5 minutes.	CDR
27821	214418	Stand by. I'll make sure I got my story straight with Control. Stand by.	CC
27822	214424	Okay.	CDR
27823	214473	11, Houston. On the RCS, what we are saying is that if we lose control about one axis prior to low gate, we would recommend an abort. This would require a - a loss of - of two distinct jets which is not very probable, but that is what we are recommending. After low gate we would continue on. We would recommend that we continue on to attempt a landing. Over.	CC
27824	214513	Roger. I think I ...	CDR
27825	214517	Roger.	CC
27826	214545	Charlie, did you say you had some updates for me from the lunar surface book?	CMP
27827	214549	Apollo 11, say again. You were cut out. Over.	CC
27828	214555	Roger. Did you say you had some updates for us in the lunar surface book. Over.	CMP
27829	214560	Negative. At this time, we do not have any updates for the lunar surface book. We wanted you to have it just in case. Over.	CC
27830	214572	Roger. You were cut out that time.	CMP
27831	214575	Roger. At the present time, we do not have any updates for you on the lunar surface book. We are thinking about some and kicking them around, but they're very minor changes. Over.	CC
27832	214597	11, Houston. Did you copy that transmission?	CC
27833	214629	Apollo 11, Houston. We swapped antennas on you again. I say again that we do not have any lunar surface update - book updates at this time. We're considering a few minor ones, but we're still kicking them around the MOCR. Over.	CC
27834	214647	Apollo 11, I understand.	CMP
27835	215131	Houston, 11. We have a crew status report for you.	CDR
27836	215134	Roger. Go ahead, 11.	CC
27837	215139	Okay. Radiation: CDR 11009, CMP 10010, LMP 09011. No medication.	CDR
27838	215155	Roger, 11. We copy for the radiations. And, we're considering - this PTC looks sort of weird to us, so we're considering stopping and starting over again, and we'll be with you in a couple of minutes. Over.	CC
27839	215175	Okay.	CDR
27840	215266	Apollo 11, Houston. Would you give us the LM/CM DELTA-P reading? Over.	CC
27841	215325	Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We switched the antennas on you again. Would you please give us the LM/CM DELTA-P reading? Over.	CC
27842	215383	Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.	CC
27843	215388	Go ahead. 11 here.	CDR
27844	215390	Roger. We switched antennas on you, there, moments ago, Neil. Could you please give us the LM/CM DELTA-P reading? Over.	CC
27845	215400	It's less than 0.1.	CDR
27846	215402	Roger.	CC
27847	215413	0.15, now, Neil says, Charlie.	CMP
27848	215416	Roger. Thank you, Mike. Could you give us some help? This PTC is strange: it's not like anything we've seen before. We were wondering if you have had any events or any odd data that could help us out. Over.	CC
27849	215435	I didn't understand that. Say again.	CMP
27850	215438	Roger. We're looking at a - sort of a funny looking PTC. We've already drifted out to 70 degrees in pitch and we're wondering if you all have had any vents or any such thing as that, that could have caused us to pick up these rates to drive us off. Over.	CC
27851	215469	Negative, Charlie. We don't know of anything.	CMP
27852	215471	Roger.	CC
27853	215473	Unless it's got something to do with that entry from the position that we want to be in. I don't know.	CMP
27854	215481	Roger. When we started off, it looked real fine to us. Now it's drifting off with a funny pattern that we haven't seen previously on a flight. And we're just trying to figure out - I think we'll probably start it over again. We'll be with you momentarily. Over.	CC
27855	215499	Okay.	CMP
27856	215712	Apollo 11, Houston. We hate to say it, but we'd like to terminate this PTC and start over again. We have no assurance that we're going to get it through the sleep period with this funny configuration, or funny pattern. We'd like you to stop it now and go back to pitch 090, yaw 0, and roll - whatever you stop on. Over.	CC
27857	215742	Roger.	CMP

27881	217377	Okay. Will do. I don't see any constraint here, Charlie. I was just checking to make sure, because last time, I went from 8 to 9 to 10 to 11 a little bit more swiftly than I'd been doing in the past.	CMP
27882	217389	Roger.	CC

27899	219011	Stand by.	CC
27900	219032	11, Houston. The PTC looks great to us. Over.	CC
27901	219038	Hey, do you have any idea what happened to the previous one?	CMP
27902	219042	We have absolutely no idea. Over.	CC
27903	219049	Okay. Did, it look like it was all right, then just all of a sudden start diverging?	CMP
27904	219057	That's negative, Mike. If you'll look at the plot, which we'll save for you and let you see it postflight, it started off immediately on the first REV and just spiraled out to about - oh 20 to - 20 degrees in pitch, and then it seemed to be setting up a spiral around an offset pitch point of about 20 degrees off from 90 degrees; but we didn't want to take a chance that it would become stable at that point. We thought it might diverge, and so we called you and started over again. Over.	CC
27905	219099	Okay, no complaints. I was just curious as to what had happened.	CMP

27928	255848	Okay. Stand by.	CDR
27929	256019	Houston, Apollo 11. Go ahead with the flight plan update.	LMP
27930	256025	Roger, 11. This is Houston. At approximately 71 hours to 72 hours, we have you down for an eat period which I imagine is probably in progress already. 71 hours: O2 fuel cell purge; 72 hours GET: CO2 filter change number 6, secondary radiator flow check. And we'll send you up a P37 block data on a 2 hour pass, pericynthion pass, return mode abort. At 73 hours 00 minutes: stop PTC at approximately 0 degrees roll. That is, when you're ccming up on 0 degrees roll angle around 73 hours, we'd like you to stop PTC. And perform a P52 option 3 remaining in the PTC REFSMMAT for a drift check. 73 hours, 20 minutes: we'll give you a P27 update to the landing site REFSMMAT, LOI 1 state vector, and target load. 73 hours 30 minutes: maneuver to 000 roll, pitch, and yaw; high gain antenna angles will be pitch 0, yaw 335; and perform a P52 option 1 using the new landing site REFSMMAT. Resume the nominal flight plan at 74 hours GET. Over.	CC
27931	256148	Okay. We'll get started on the fuel cell purge while we're eating. CO2 canister change number 6; secondary radiator flow check; copy some pads. Also at 72 hours, stop PTC 0 roll at 73; do a P52 option 3; we'll get your uplink REFSMMAT for the landing site; and at 000 - let's see, now was this with the old REFSMMAT or the new REFSMMAT?	LMP

27958	257054	Okay. We're ready to listen.	LMP
27959	257058	Okay, 11. It turns out that the engine performance during both of your burns so far this mission has been the same as it was on engine acceptance tests. The onboard PC reading is due to a known gage calibration factor between what you've actually got in the chamber and what you're reading out on the gage. We expect single bank operation to be 90 - that is, 90 psi on the gage with an actual chamber pressure of 95 psi. In dual bank operation, the chamber pressure is 94 psi on the gage with an actual of 99 psi. 80 psi on the gage on board correlates to 83 psi actual. And we recommend that you stick to an LOI termination cue of 80 psi on the gage. That is, no change to the mission rules. Over.	CC
27960	257137	Apollo 11. Roger. We got all that.	CDR
27961	257140	Houston. Out.	CC

27966	257627	Houston, do you read Apollo 11?	CDR
27967	257629	Roger, 11. We're reading you loud and clear now. We were down in the noise as we switched antennas a minute or so ago. Over.	CC
27968	257640	Roger. What sort of settings could you recommend for the solar corona? We've got the Sun right behind the edge of the Moon now.	CMP
27969	257652	Roger.	CC
27970	257656	It's quite an erie sight. There is a very marked three dimensional aspect of having the Sun's corona coming from behind the Moon the way it is.	LMP
27971	257667	Roger.	CC
27972	257671	And it looks as though - I guess what's giving it that three dimensional effect is the earthshine. I can see Tycho fairly clearly - at least if I'm right side up, I believe it's Tycho, in moonshine - I mean, in earthshine. And, of course, I can see the sky is lit all the way around the Moon, even on the limb of it where there's no earthshine or sunshine.	LMP
27973	257740	Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.	CC
27974	257745	Go ahead.	LMP
27975	257747	Roger. If you'd like to take some pictures, we recommend using magazine Uniform which is loaded with high speed black and white film, interior lights off, electric Hasselblad with the 80 millimeter lens. And you're going to have to hand hold us, I guess. We're recommending an f stop of 2.8, and we'd like to get a sequence of time exposures. Over.	CC
27976	257784	Okay. You want magazine Uniform instead of magazine Tango? Over.	LMP
27977	257790	Roger. We're not trying to get you all wrapped up in a procedure here. This is on a not to interfere basis, of course. Over.	CC
27978	257803	Okay.	LMP
27979	257806	And on the exposures we're looking for an eighth of a second, a half a second. And, if you think you can steady the camera against anything to get longer exposures, 2 seconds, 4 seconds, and 8 seconds. Over.	CC
27980	257831	Roger. We copy.	LMP

27984	257965	Roger. We'd like to do a little CRYO tank balancing. So, if you could position the oxygen tank number 1 heater switch to OFF and hydrogen tank 2 heater switch to OFF leaving all the rest of the CRY0 switches the same, we'll let it run that way for a few hours. Over.	CC
27985	257988	Okay. Stand by one on those switches. We'll get them in a minute.	CMP
27986	257991	Roger. And how far out can you see the corona extending? Over.	CC
27987	258013	... bit like zodiacal light. It keeps going out farther and farther. We'll talk about it a little more later.	CDR

27991	258267	Apollo 11, this is Houston. Were you calling? Over.	CC
27992	258288	Houston, Apollo 11. Understand you want the heaters OFF for hydrogen tank 1 and oxygen tank 1. Is that affirmative?	CMP
27993	258296	That's negative, Mike. Hydrogen tank number 2 heaters OFF and oxygen tank number 1 heaters OFF.	CC
27994	258305	Okay.	CMP
27995	258307	Roger. Out.	CC
27996	258312	I have hydrogen tank number 2 heaters OFF; I have oxygen tank number 1 heaters OFF.	CMP

27999	258744	Oh, very good.	CC
28000	258960	And, Houston, I'd suggest that along the ecliptic line we can see the corona light out to two lunar diameters from this location. The bright light only extends out about an eighth to a quarter of the lunar radius.	CDR
28001	258995	Roger. Understand that you can see the corona approximately 200 solar diameters out along the ecliptic, and the bright light extends out approximately one eighth to one quarter lunar radius. Over.	CC
28002	259012	That's two lunar - two lunar diameters along the ecliptic in the bright part, right; a quarter to an eighth of a lunar radius out, and that's perpendicular to the ecliptic line on the South Pole.	CDR
28003	259027	Roger.	CC
28004	259160	Houston, it's been a real change for us. Now we are able to see stars again and recognize constellations for the first time on the trip. It's - the sky is full of stars. Just like the nightside of Earth. But all the way here, we have only been able to see stars occasionally and perhaps through the monocular, but not recognize any star patterns.	CDR
28005	259192	I guess it has turned into night up there really, hasn't it ?	CC

28009	260078	Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do you read? Over.	CC
28010	260083	Okay. We went to HIGH GAIN. Looks like you had a little trouble getting signal strength there.	CDR
28011	260089	Roger. We missed an 0MNI switch there. Over.	CC
28012	260095	All right. On the secondary loop check when we went to FLOW on the secondary radiators, the quantity dropped from 40 percent down to 36 in the first 10 seconds and then stabilized at 36 for the remainder of the 30 seconds.	CDR
28013	260130	Apollo 11, this is Houston. We believe that is normal system operation. The radiators are expected to be very cold right now and apparently the decrease you saw was due to contraction in the fluid. Over.	CC
28014	260149	Okay. We will go ahead with the procedure just as if there were no decrease in accumulator quantity. Right?	CDR
28015	260155	Roger. Press on.	CC
28016	260245	And, Houston, the secondary radiator flow check is complete and satisfactory.	CDR
28017	260251	Houston. Roger. Out.	CC
28018	260260	And that's a good deal because we don't have to have any meetings about whether we're going to do it or don't do it any more.	CMP

28050	261071	In Moscow, space engineer Anatol Koritsky was quoted by TASS as saying that Luna 15 could accomplish everything that has been done by earlier Luna spacecraft. This was taken by the press to mean Luna 15 could investigate the gravitational fields, photograph the Moon, and go down to the surface to scoop up a bit for analysis.	CC

28059	261242	You might be interested in knowing, since you are already on the way, that a Houston astrologer, Ruby Graham, says that all the signs are right for your trip to the Moon. She says that Neil is clever, Mike has good judgment, and Buzz can work out intricate problems. She also says Neil tends to see the world through rose colored glasses, but he is always ready to help the afflicted or distressed. Neil, you are also suppose to have "intuition that enables you to interpret life with feeling." Buzz is to be very sociable and cannot bear to be alone in addition to having excellent critical ability.

28157	266672	Roger. At GET of 74 30, we'd like you to cycle the fans in all four CRYO tanks and position the heaters in all four CRYO tanks to the AUTO position. We're doing this in advance of LOI in order to insure that you don't have any destratification as a result of the burn, which might result in giving you a master caution and warning during the burn.

28276	277002	Roger. We show you, in the flight plan, staying in orbital rate until about 79 hours 10 minutes. Do you have some particular attitude or reason for wanting to go inertial? Over.	CC
28277	277020	No, that's fine. I just wanted to confirm that. Until 79 10, then we'll breeze around here in orbit.	LMP

28279	277048	Roger. We just went into spacecraft darkness. Until then, why, we couldn't see a thing down below us. But now, with earthshine, the visibility is pretty fair. Looking back behind me, now, I can see the corona from where the Sun has just set. And we'll get out the map and see what we can find around Aristarchus	LMP
28280	277074	We're coming upon Aristarchus right now - -	CDR

28283	277116	Roger. Out.	CC
28284	277381	Houston, 11. It might help us a little bit if you could give us a time of crossing of 45 west.	LMP
28285	277389	Say again, please, 11.	CC
28286	277403	You might give us a time of crossing of 45 west, and then we'll know when to start searching for Aristarchus.	LMP

28300	277926	Roger. Seems to me since we know orbits so precisely, and know where the stars are so precisely, and the time of setting of a star or a planet to so very fine a degree, that this might be a pretty good means of measuring the altitude of the horizon ...	LMP
28301	277952	Roger.	CC
28302	277971	Hey, Houston. I'm looking north up toward Aristarchus now, and I can't really tell at that distance whether I am really looking at Aristarchus, but there's an area that is considerably more illuminated than the surrounding area. It just has - seems to have a slight amount of fluorescence to it. A crater can be seen, and the area around the crater is quite bright.	CMP
28303	278010	Roger, 11. We copy.	CC

28306	278134	Roger. That's an inner wall of the crater.	CMP
28307	278143	No, there doesn't appear to be any color involved in it, Bruce.	LMP
28308	278147	Roger. You said inner wall. Would that be the inner edge of the northern surface?	CC
28309	278160	I guess it would be the inner edge of the westnorthwest part, the part that would be more nearly normal if you were looking at it from the Earth.	CMP

28348	282235	Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.	CC
28349	282249	This is Apollo 11. Are you picking up our signals okay?	LMP
28350	282263	- - No, no, no - -	LMP
28351	282264	- - the bottom of the picture. I guess that's the spot on the tube.	CC
28352	282270	I'm sorry about that one.	LMP
28353	282273	And if you give us P00 and ACCEPT, we will uplink our new state vector and target load to you.	CC
28354	282285	Okay.	CMP
28355	282330	Houston, Apollo 11. One of the larger craters on the back side - I noticed a small, dark speck on the outer wall and I put the monocular on it. I was able to see - oh, an area maybe a quarter of a mile in diameter. It was really a freshlooking dark colored pit, and that seems to be in contrast with all the other fresh little craters or holes that you can perceive on the walls of any of these craters. Around this particular one there seems to be two or three of these - especially the one that caught my attention. Quite remarkable. Over.	LMP
28356	282384	Roger. Do you have a location on that one?	CC
28357	282394	No, not a precise one. I've got several pictures of it, though.	LMP
28358	282398	Roger. We copy.	CC
28359	282407	We're getting a beautiful picture in down there now, 11. The color's coming in quite clearly, and we can see the horizon and the relative blackness of space, and without getting into the question of grays and browns, it looks, at least on our monitor, sort of a brownish gray.	CC
28360	282430	That's a good, reasonable way of describing it. It appears to me as though it made a difference just sitting back in the tunnel and gazing at all windows; it makes a difference which one you're looking out of. For example, the camera	LMP
28361	282465	Roger.	CC
28362	282473	And if you rear back 95 or 100 degrees ...	LMP
28363	282474	... Still holding ... Okay.	MS
28364	282482	Say again, 11?	CC
28365	282487	I'd say we're about 95 degrees east, coming up on Smyth's Sea.	LMP
28366	282491	Roger. And for your information, we show you at an altitude of about 92 miles above the surface right now.	CC
28367	282501	Okay.	LMP
28368	282502	Houston, Apollo 11. Could you observe a difference in the N2 pressures before LOI? It seems to me as though the two were not equal on the ... B tank was a little low on pressure. Over.	CMP
28369	282537	I'm flying it in SPS minimum impulse, Houston, and it's rather difficult to keep it on a constant data. The LM wants to wander up and down. I'm not sure if it's in response to MASCONN's or what, but I can get it completely stabilized in DATA and let it alone, and in another couple of minutes it will have developed its own rate.	CMP
28370	282562	This is Houston. Roger.	CC
28371	282570	Houston, we'll be moving shortly from the side window to the hatch window, and we'll try and pick up some of the landmarks that we'll be looking at as we approach the powered descent. Over.	CMP
28372	282587	11, this is Houston. Roger. And we're through with the uplinks; the computer is yours. You can go to BLOCK and we'll have the information on nitrogen for you shortly. Over.	CC
28373	282601	Roger. Copy.	CMP
28374	282608	Okay, Houston. Several minutes ago I was exactly steady on data, and since then I have been moving	LMP
28375	282630	Roger.	CC
28376	282649	We're over Smyth's Sea right now.	LMP
28377	282651	Roger.	CC
28378	282656	We're about 88 degrees east, I would estimate.	CMP
28379	282664	We show you about south of the - southwest of the crater Jansky right now.	CC
28380	282688	Smyth Sea doesn't look much like a sea. It - The area which is devoid of craters, of which there's not very much, is sort of a hilly looking area. It's not like the maria at all.	CMP
28381	282701	Roger. We copy that about the sea, and it looks like you were just giving us a view of the crater Neper, the large crater on the left, and Jansky on the right.	CC
28382	282726	We think you're close, but no cigar.	CMP
28383	282800	11, this is Houston. Would you care to comment on some of these craters as we go by?	CC
28384	282809	Roger. We're approaching the approach path to ignition. This is equivalent to 13 minutes before ignition, and we're at about 83 degrees, I guess - 83 degrees east. That correspond to location you're holding there presently?	CDR
28385	282839	Roger. We're showing your present position as about 77 - 76 degrees east looking back towards the east.	CC
28386	282856	Hey, you should be looking back at Smyth Sea now.	CMP
28387	282859	Roger.	CC
28388	282863	Okay.	CDR
28389	282865	Houston, what you're seeing in the middle of the screen now is the crater Schubert and Gilbert U is in the center right now; and this comes up at about - a little over 12 minutes before power decent. Instead of me looking - Instead of looking back at it, we'd be looking straight down at it in descent.	CMP
28390	282890	Roger.	CC
28391	282895	And we show you at an altitude now of about 110 miles; and, of course, you'll be considerably lower at the initiation of powered descent.	CC
28392	282918	Okay, Houston. Look at register 3 on the DSKY data. This data is increasing toward my desired of 315; and I'll let the hand controller alone here, and I'll bet you it reverses itself.	CMP
28393	282946	Roger, 11. We're watching the DSKY now, and it's still coming in beautifully on the TV.	CC
28394	282959	Okay. There's - on the right side of the screen at the present time, there's a triple crater with - with a small crater between the first and second; and the one at the bottom of the screen is Schubert Y. Zoom in; it does have a central peak in Schubert Y. Actually, several of them, and you can observe those plus the rim craters at the bottom of your screen.	LMP
28395	282996	Roger. We're seeing the central peak quite clearly now.	CC
28396	283013	Okay. We're zooming in now on a crater called Schubert N. Schubert N, very conical inside walls and the bottom appears to be nearly flat.	LMP
28397	283031	Look at data on the DSKY. It's stabilized and is holding steady now.	CMP
28398	283039	Roger.	CC
28399	283040	Looking out the window I can see a number of small craters on the bottom of Schubert N.	LMP
28400	283052	We're coming up on the Foaming Sea where I'll be doing some P22 marking on a crater of my choice, name of crater, Camp.	CMP
28401	283061	Okay. We'll be watching for Neper.	CC
28402	283069	And notice register 3 has reversed itself, and it's heading back the other way now without any pitch thruster firing.	CMP
28403	283076	Roger, Mike. We confirm that you've changed the direction of your pitch rate.	CC
28404	283108	Generally speaking - -	CMP
28405	283110	The crater - -	LMP
28406	283111	- - The tendency seems to be to pull the LM down toward the center of the Moon there as in a gravity gradient experiment.	CMP
28407	283120	Roger, 11. We copy - -	CC
28408	283123	It may have something to do with MASSCON's or it may - -	CMP
28409	283126	Roger. We copy ...	CC
28410	283127	...	LMP
28411	283128	It may have something to do with MASSCON's or it may just be the peculiarity of the DSKY display.	CMP
28412	283131	Okay. We've observed the behavior of your DSKY, and I think we've got the data here to work on it. Let us grind around a little while on it, and we'll report back to you, probably in a REV or two.	CC
28413	283148	Okay. Well, in the meantime, I'm going to pitch down toward 315.	CMP
28414	283154	Roger.	CC
28415	283165	Three craters - three horizontal craters that you now have in the field of view are immediately underneath the ground track. The right hand is the largest crater that you see, Dubiago P.	LMP
28416	283189	Roger. We concur on the identification of that crater.	CC
28417	283201	And we show you coming up on landmark Alfa 1 here shortly.	CC
28418	283211	Roger. Mike's having his first look at Alfa 1 at the present time.	LMP
28419	283222	Yea. It's a very bright crater. It's not a large one but an extremely bright one. It looks like a very recent and, I would guess, impact crater with rays streaming out in all directions which should make my - Correction - the Foaming Sea easy to see coming up on it now. Crater Camp is one of the smaller ones out on the - on the floor of the Foaming Sea.	CMP
28420	283294	Here we show you over the Sea of Fertility now, and we ought to have Langrenus down south of track a few degrees, about 9 degrees south of track.	CC
28421	283308	Now the crater that's in the center of the screen now is Webb. We'd be looking straight down on it at about 6 minutes before power descent. It has a relatively flat bottom to the crater, and you can see maybe two or three craters that are in the bottom of it on the western wall, the wall that's now nearest the - the camera. Near the bottom of the screen, we can see a dimple crater, just on the outside. And then coming back toward the bottom of the screen and to the left, you can see a series of depressions. It's this type of connected craters that give us most interest to discover why they're in the particular pattern that they're in. I'll zoom the camera in now and try and give you a closer look at it.	LMP
28422	283368	Roger. We're observing the dimple crater now. The central peak we can see on the Orbiter photos doesn't seem to stand out very well here.	CC
28423	283382	Well, they're not central peaks. They're depressions in the center.	LMP
28424	283385	Roger.	CC
28425	283388	And you'll notice on the pitch thruster activity, I've still - I've put in a dozen mininum impulses in pitchdown, and I'm still far from correcting back to 315.	CMP
28426	283400	We're moving the camera over to the right window now to give you Langrenus, its - its several central peaks and -	LMP
28427	283409	Roger. We got Langrenus in our screen now.	CC
28428	283434	Okay, 11. This is Houston. We're getting a beautiful picture of Langrenus now with its rather conspicuous central peak.	CC
28429	283447	The Sea of Fertility doesn't look very fertile to me. I don't know who named it.	CMP
28430	283452	Well, it may have been named by a gentleman whom this crater was named after, Langrenus. Langrenus was a cartographer to the King of Spain and made one of the - one of the early reasonably accurate maps of the Moon.	CDR
28431	283479	Roger. That's very interesting - -	CC
28432	283481	... at least it sounds better for our purposes than the Sea of Crises.	CDR
28433	283486	Amen to that.	CC
28434	283492	Okay. It looks like you're coming inside now on the camera.	CC
28435	283499	Well, I can't get behind to see the monitor. I'll bring the focus in, but we're going to be looking down past one of the LM quads and one of the antennas almost straight down at the ground track that we'll be seeing coming in now. I guess there's maybe 2 or 3 minutes before power descent.	LMP
28436	283537	All right, that should put the LM structure about in focus, and I'm going to move it out to infinity and then expand the field of view.	LMP
28437	283560	Crater Secchi is out my window now, window number 2.	LMP
28438	283569	Hello, Apollo 11. This is Houston. We show you coming up on the terminator at 78 53, about 7 minutes from now, and we've also got the LOI 2 and TEI 5 PAD's ready for you after the TV whenever you want to terminate. Over.	CC
28439	283591	Roger.	LMP
28440	283593	And we're getting a good view of the track leading into the landing site now and -	CC
28441	283618	Okay, And it looks like we got Secchi K, went by about 10 seconds ago; coming up on Apollo Ridge.	CC
28442	283656	And in the right hand portion of our screen right now, we can see Messier Alfa and Bravo with the light colored rays streaming off in one direction.	CC
28443	283680	I don't know if you can make out, but in the Sea of Fertility there are a number of craters that are just barely discernible, old, old craters whose outlines are just barely able to be seen.	LMP
28444	283694	Roger. I think we can make them out. The color really enhances our ability to discern features and craters over what we see in real time on our black and white monitor.	CC
28445	283711	Right. The - At these low Sun angles, there's no trace of brown, it's now returned to a very gray appearance and, like the 8 crew says, it has a look of plaster of paris to it at this Sun angle, which is completely lacking in ...	LMP
28446	283729	Roger.	CC
28447	283746	Okay. This is very close to ignition point for power descent. Just passing Mount Marilyn that - that triangular shaped mountain that you see in the center of the screen at the present time with crater Secchi Theta on top of the far northern edge of the mountain.	LMP
28448	283772	Roger. We're getting a good view of Mount Marilyn and the Secchi Theta.	CC
28449	283785	And now we're looking at what we call Boot Hill; occurs 20 seconds into the descent.	LMP
28450	283808	The bright, sharp rimmed crater at the very right edge of the screen, Censorinus T. Now passing the - the 1 minute point in power descent.	LMP
28451	283830	Roger. And for your information, your current altitude is 148 nautical miles above the surface.	CC
28452	283839	Don't you think?	LMP
28453	283843	I'm unable to determine altitude at all looking out the window. I couldn't tell whether we were down at 60 or up at 170.	CMP
28454	283850	I bet you could tell if you were down at 50,000 feet.	CC
28455	283857	I wouldn't be surprised.	CMP
28456	283871	We're passing some steep ridges here. The edge of some old craters that were photographed by Apollo 10; and those - the crew of Apollo 10 was very impressed with the steepness of these ridges when they came over them at about 50,000 feet.	LMP
28457	283896	Roger. We can observe they're also steep even from this altitude. You got quite a shadow being cast by the Sun at these low angles.	CC
28458	283907	The entire surface is getting considerably darker than the surface that we looked at previously when the Sun was quite high above us. The crater in the - bright crater in the center of the screen, - well, the smaller one is Censorinus.	LMP
28459	283929	Roger. And we show you low over 1 minute from the terminator at the present time.	CC
28460	283944	How's the brightness of the picture you're receiving? You think we ought to open f stop some as we approach the terminator?	LMP
28461	283954	Yes. The brightness is still doing quite well. You can go ahead and open it up a stop or two. The automatic light level compensation seems to be working beautifully.	CC
28462	283978	There's a good picture of Boot Hill.	LMP
28463	283982	Roger. We're - -	CC
28464	283983	Three minutes and 15 seconds into the descent.	LMP
28465	283988	Roger. We're seeing Boot Hill now.	CC
28466	283990	The next crater coming into the bottom, that's Duke Island right there, and to the left, the crater - the largest of the craters near the center of the picture right now is Maskelyne W. This is a position check during descent at about 3 minutes and 39 seconds, and it's our down range position check and cross range position check prior to yawing over face up to acquire the landing radar. Past this point, we would be unable to see the surface below us until getting very near the landing area.	LMP
28467	284037	Roger. I imagine you'll get a - you'll get a real good look at that tomorrow afternoon.	CC
28468	284054	Sinuous Rille is the one that was referred to in Apollo 10 as Sidewinder.	LMP
28469	284061	That's a good name, too: Sidewinder and Diamondback. It looks like a couple of snakes down there in a lake bed.	CMP
28470	284082	And we're approaching the terminator now. See the - -	LMP
28471	284088	Roger.	CC
28472	284089	Contrast has increased and only the sunlit side of these ridges remain illuminated, while the dark sides and the shadow will become completely black.	LMP
28473	284099	11, this is Houston. The picture's getting a little grainy now. You might go ahead and open up the f stop.	CC
28474	284119	Landing point is just barely in the darkness. That one crater, the upper part of which you see, lower part completely in darkness. The small, well defined crater is Moltke, which is about abeam of the landing sight.	LMP
28475	284132	Roger. We can just see; it looks like a little less than half of its rim right now.	CC
28476	284145	And we can make out just barely some features on the surface, maybe from earthshine.	CC
28477	284158	Are you wide open on the f stop at this time?	CC
28478	284163	Yes, we are.	CMP
28479	284166	Yes. And it looks like we're just about to get the Sun coming into the lens, so we'll have to move the camera away.	LMP
28480	284172	Roger.	CC
28481	284174	We can't see any earthshine or any surface features at all in earthshine now due to the fact that the LM is very bright and is causing our pupils to contract. It's a very fantastic view to see the terminator as you look along the edge of it. I think you'll agree that some of these craters that you're seeing in the picture now are really accentuated by the lengthening of the shadows as they come close to the terminator.	CMP
28482	284202	Yes. It's a very beautiful and a rugged sight that we've got on the screen now.	CC
28483	284212	And I think you've got some interesting data on thruster firing versus pitch angle. It looks	CMP
28484	284221	Roger. I have a comment here that says that's what the LM was built for.	CC
28485	284232	I believe!	CMP
28486	284265	And as the Moon sinks slowly in the west, Apollo 11 bids good day to you.	CMP
28487	284270	Roger. We sort of thought it was the Sun setting in the east.	CC
28488	284280	Well, it depends on your point of view.	CMP
28489	284284	Roger. Out.	CC
28490	284300	Apollo 11, Houston. When you're ready to copy, I have an LOI 2 PAD and a TEI 5 PAD. Over.	CC
28491	284310	Okay. Stand by.	CMP
28492	284326	I'm passing 182 inertial. I'm going inertial now.	CMP
28493	284334	Ready to copy LOI 2 PAD.	LMP

Remarks: On your DAP load, we would like an R1 20101 vice the value which appears in the flight plan. In making the sextant star check this must be done between GET of 79 30 10, at which time the star comes above the horizon, and 79 52 10, which is your local sunrise due to the fact that this star's relatively close to the Sun. Your burn orientation is heads down, retrograde pitched up 28 degress with respect to local horizontal. The calculated values for NOUN 42 are HA 65.6 and HP 54.6. Both of those being plus. Read back.

28513	285739	Okay.	LMP
28514	285743	Our chamber pressure onboard was higher that time, too. It's all on the onboard tape, the time entry, and the chamber pressure; but to make a long story short, it worked its way up to 100.	CMP
28515	285754	Roger.	CC

28571	291426	It isn't true everywhere, but there's certainly places where there seems to be a slope downward towards the shoreline on the mare. In other words, from the mare down to the shoreline is a downward slope indicating that it might be a lava flow.	CDR

28612	298346	All that procedure for P22 seemed to work very well. The only thing that was a little odd, is that there was some DAP thruster activity. I had pitch in ACCEL COMMAND, and roll and yaw in RATE COMMAND, and somehow, roll and yaw got excited and the DAP went into a flurry of thruster firing. We've noticed the same thing in the CMS, and just written it off as a CMS peculiarity.	CMP

28727	300763	Good idea.	CMP

28729	300774	Roger.	CC
28730	300811	Apollo 11, Houston. Also, that water that you got on the aft bulkhead, we - If it's not too much, we just recommend sopping it up and then throwing the sponges away in the waste stowage area. If it's too much, then we recommend using the procedure in the checklist on page F10-14. Over.	CC
28731	300838	All right. Thank you.	CMP
28732	301045	Apollo 11, Houston. Would you have Buzz make sure he gives us the OPS pressure readings before you close up? Over.	CC
28733	301055	Will do.	CMP
28734	301081	Houston, 11. The OPS read 5750, both bottles.	CDR

28737	304280	Houston, Apollo 11.	CMP
28738	304281	11, Houston. Roger. Reading you fine, and it looks like the automatic REACQ went very well just as soon as you came around the limb. We have several small items to discuss with you here just before you go to sleep. Over.	CC
28739	304289	Go ahead. Over.	CMP
28740	304300	Okay, 11. First of all, on our LM systems checks, everything went fine. I would like to remind you, though, tomorrow you may see an ascent pressure light when you activate the MC&W. There should be no problem, however. You did note that the APS AUX tank pressure was only reading 111 psi, which is normal at this point, but below the level which will trigger your light due to the helium which has been dissolved into the propellant. Over.	CC
28741	304338	Roger. Understand that. Thank you.	CMP
28742	304340	Roger. And next item, the supercritical helium rise rate is nominal, and you also had that question for us about your thruster activity during the P22 on the last REV. Believe we understand that now, as you reported that your pitch was in ACCEL COMMAND and your yaw and roll were in RATE COMMAND. You were firing your pitch thrusters. This will couple rates into your yaw and roll axes, and the - You were at that time holding only half a degree deadband and coupling rates into yaw and roll produced the extra firings about the yaw and roll axes. Over.	CC
28743	304387	Yes. That may be true. It's very peculiar coupling, in that it waits longer than you would think and its reaction is greater than you would think. We were getting yaw rates of around four tenths of a degree per second, for example.	CMP
28744	304403	Roger, Mike. We did play the data back, and that's the way it looked upon analysis of the chart recordings back here. Over.	CC
28745	304415	Okay. Fine.	CMP
28746	304416	They've also looked at the results of your landmark tracking. The marks all apparently were very good, and we've got a full page of data here relative to the altitudes of the various site locations, which I won't read up to you, but I did want to let you know that the marks apparently went very well. I also have your consumable budgets, particularly your RCS propellant quantities. They're Deltas from nominal if you should want them. Your worst quad is quad Charlie, which is 9 percent low. I'll not read up the others unless you want them. Over.	CC
28747	304457	Okay. How about the O2 fuel cell purge? You want that now?	CMP
28748	304462	I'll have to stand by just a moment.	CC
28749	304466	Okay. And then the other one is, we're still charging battery A.	LMP
28750	304528	11, Houston. We would like to delay the fuel cell purge until the backside of the Moon, and you go ahead and - should terminate your battery charge at this time. Over.	CC
28751	304543	Okay. Understand. I knew we had another O2 and H2 purge coming up in the morning; I wasn't sure whether you wanted to go through with this one or not. I'll wait until the next side and then do it.	LMP
28752	304553	That's fine, Buzz.	CC
28753	304554	Terminate battery charging now.	LMP
28754	304556	That's right, and one other systems item here - in order to balance your CRYO tanks, would you get your O2 tank 1 and your H 2 tank 2 heaters off? Over.	CC
28755	304576	Okay. I have O2 tank heater 1 off, and H2 tank heater 2 off.	CMP
28756	304585	That's right, Mike, and we believe you have your quad Bravo and quad Charlie turned off in your DAP at this time, and a 5 degree deadband. We'd prefer a 10 degree deadband for your sleep period overnight here. Over.	CC
28757	304603	Okay.	CMP
28758	304607	One other item relative to a malfunction procedure. It's unlikely that you'll have to worry about this	CC
28759	304658	Understand, and note has been made in my checklist.	CMP
28760	304665	11, Houston. Roger. That just about takes care of all the items we have here on the ground before time to hit the sack, and I guess you will have a presleep check for us before you go to bed.	CC
28761	304686	Roger. We're in the midst of cycling the O2 and H2 fans now.	LMP

28766	304916	11, Houston. Go ahead.	CC
28767	304921	Roger. We're thinking about taking the monocular with us on into the LM. We think it might prove to be of some use. Over.	LMP
28768	304930	Roger, Buzz. It sounds like a good idea for some of your surveying work there inside the cockpit. Over.	CC
28769	304941	Okay. You want to run that by with whoever might be concerned?	LMP
28770	304944	I sure will.	CC
28771	305267	Apollo 11, Houston. We have apparently lost the high gain lock. We would appreciate it if you would give us a help manually to try to relock up on the high gain. Over.	CC

28773	305292	11, Houston. Reading you very weak, still too far down in the noise to complete the full transmission. If you'd give us a hand on a manual relock, we'd appreciate it.	CC
28774	305522	Apollo 11, Houston. We're still unable to pick you up on the high gain antenna. Request you go to MANUAL, and wide beamwidth. The pitch and yaw angles in your checklist are good ones. You should be able to find us there. Over.	CC

28778	305601	Roger. Are you in wide beam now?	CC
28779	305609	Negative. I got you locked back on again REACQ and narrow.	LMP
28780	305613	Roger. That's all we want. We want to stay in narrow, and we're a little puzzled about why we lost you here a few minutes ago. Do you have any ideas?	CC
28781	305628	No, we sure don't (cough) - sure don't. We're showing - we're showing about 15 degrees plus pitch and about 270. That ought to be good and clear.	LMP
28782	305640	We concur there. We still don't have any good ideas on why we were lost then.	CC
28783	305678	11, Houston. Would you confirm that we did acquire automatically when you came around the limb for this passage. Over.	CC
28784	305691	That's confirmed.	LMP

28788	306286	11, Houston. On your AUTO RCS SELECT switches, we show quad Bravo disabled but quad Charlie only partially disabled. Charlie 3, I believe, is the only one you have selected off. Is that correct?	CC
28789	306305	Yes. Roger. That's correct.	CMP
28790	306306	Roger.	CC
28791	306359	How do they look to you now, Houston?	CMP
28792	306366	11, Houston. We see them all disabled at this time. Thank you.	CC
28793	306375	Thank you.	CMP

28795	306570	Go ahead, Houston.	LMP
28796	306571	11, Houston. We're going to try to check out this ability to automatically reacquire on the S band, and what we want to do is to secure our uplink carrier for about 30 seconds. Then we will turn it back on and see if the spacecraft equipment will automatically reacquire. So if you do not get a call from us within about 3 minutes, that means we have not been able to reacquire and request your assistance on a manual acquisition. Over.	CC
28797	306604	Okay. We understand.	LMP
28798	306611	11, Houston. We also would appreciate - if you will note the angles that the antenna tracks through in its attempt to reacquire. Over.	CC
28799	306626	Roger. We'll do that.	LMP
28800	306808	11, Houston. It looks like we're locked back up again with no delay. How does it look on board? Over.	CC
28801	306817	Roger. The signal strength dropped very rapidly to zero; and the pitch and yaw, in about 3 secconds, moved toward 40 degrees pitch and 240 degrees yaw. Right now, they're sitting on about 15 degrees pitch and about 265 degrees yaw. So they didn't move very far, about 30 degrees apiece; and then they picked right back on up again. Over.	LMP
28802	306859	Roger. Some of "The Luckiest People" in the background there. We copied your pitch and yaw angles.	CC
28803	306927	11, Houston. Could you give us the location of your - pitch and yaw location of your position indicators? Over.	CC
28804	306939	Roger. They're in the same position as the antenna right now; plus 15 degrees pitch and - no, now wait a minute. I got them - got it at about 275 instead of 265.	LMP
28805	306957	Okay. Thank you.	CC
28806	306983	11, Houston. We'd like to try the same procedure once more. We'll leave the carrier a little longer and be back up for a call within 4 minutes. Over.	CC
28807	306995	Okay.	LMP
28808	307207	11, Houston. We're locked back up again. Can you give us a report on how the antenna behaved?	CC
28809	307224	Roger. It was essentially identical as before. The pitch went to 45, 40 to 45 and the yaw went to about - to about 255, 245 to 255; and then it rather quickly locked up at 15 degrees pitch and 270 yaw. Over.	LMP
28810	307249	11, Houston. Roger. Your angles are 45 and 255. Do I understand that as soon as the carrier dropped, it went to these angles; or did it only go to these angles after the uplink carrier was reenabled and the antenna began to reacquire? Over.	CC
28811	307272	No. As soon as the carrier dropped off, why, it drifted over into those angles and stayed there. Then when it came back up again, why, it hunted around for a while, but it didn't get any further off. Gradually brought it on in to the angles where it is right now; and then the signal strength would take several jumps as evidently it goes from wide to medium to narrow. Over.	LMP
28812	307298	11, Houston. Understand. And on another subject, request you zero your optics for the night. Over.	CC
28813	307318	Roger. Zeroed.	LMP
28814	307666	Apollo 11, Houston. Can you confirm that you have changed the CO2 filter as per flight plan in the last hour? Over?	CC
28815	307681	No. We're still eating. We're about to do it. We'll let you know.	CMP
28816	307684	Roger, 11. And we've got about 14 minutes until LOS. A0S is 86 30, an hour away. We're wondering whether or not you plan to have one man up at that time or would you all like to be asleep inside the next hour? Over.	CC
28817	307705	Somebody will be up.	CMP
28818	307707	Roger. The thing that we're still puzzling on is the antenna, and if - as long as there will be somebody up, why, we would like to have somebody check the automatic REACQ on the next AOS.	CC
28819	307722	Okay. We'll do that. We haven't chlorinated the water yet, and we haven't changed the lithium hydroxide. We're just still finishing up dinner.	CMP

28826	311444	Okay. We just appeared to get a solid lock for the last - oh, about a minute. The ... needle's been wandering up and down, and the pitch and yaw needles have been wandering around, but it appears to have reacquired by itself solidly now. We're just finishing up our fuel cell purge. Hydrogen on number 3 is the last to go off. It'll be coming off in just a second.	CMP
28827	311469	Roger, 11.	CC
28828	311537	Apollo 11, Houston. We believe we've tracked down the reacquisition problem we had on the previous REV. It looks like it was a receiver power supply here on the ground and no problems in the spacecraft at all. Over.	CC
28829	311555	Okay. Glad to hear it.	CMP

An ancient legend says a beautiful Chinese girl called Chang-o has been living there for 4000 years. It seems she was banished to the Moon because she stole the pill of immortality from her husband. You might also look for her companion, a large Chinese rabbit, who is easy to spot since he is always standing on his hind feet in the shade of a cinnamon tree.

CDRTRAN
29707	370549	Roger. We copy. It was beautiful from here, Tranquility. Over.	CC
29708	370562	We'll get to the details of what's around here, but it looks like a collection of just about every variety of shape, angularity, granularity, about every variety of rock you could find. The colors - Well, it varies pretty much depending on how you're looking relative to the zerophase point. There doesn't appear to be too much of a general color at all. However, it looks as though some of the rocks and boulders, of which there are quite a few in the near area, it looks as though they're going to have some interesting colors to them. Over.	LMPTRAN
29709	370607	Roger. Copy. Sounds good to us, Tranquility. We'll let you press on through the simulated countdown, and we'll talk to you later. Over.	CC

29731	370923	Houston, the guys that said that we wouldn't be able to tell precisely where we are are the winners today. We were a little busy worrying about program alarms and things like that in the part of the descent where we would normally be picking out our landing spot; and aside from a good look at several of the craters we came over in the final descent, I haven't been able to pick out the things on the horizon as a reference as yet.

29732	370961	Roger, Tranquility. No sweat. We'll figure out - We'll figure it out. Over.	CC
29733	371012	You might be interested to know that I don't think we notice any difficulty at all in adapting to one sixth g. It seems immediately natural to move in this environment.	CDRTRAN
29734	371027	Roger, Tranquility. We copy. Over.	CC
29735	371035	The area out the left hand window is a relatively level plain cratered with a fairly large number of craters of the 5 to 50 foot variety, and some ridges - small, 20, 30 feet high, I would guess, and literally thousands of little 1 and 2 foot craters around the area. We see some angular blocks out several hundred feet in front of us that are probably 2 feet in size and have angular edges. There is a hill in view, just about on the ground track ahead of us. Difficult to estimate, but might be a half a mile or a mile.	CDRTRAN

29758	371315	Roger. Copy, Tranquility. That gravity align looked good to us. We see you recycling.	CC
29759	371327	Well, no. I was trying to get time, 16 65 out, and somehow it proceeded on to the 622 before I could do a VERB 32 ENTER. I want to log a time here, and then I'd like to know whether you want me to proceed on the torquing angles or to go back and reenter again before torquing. Over.	LMPTRAN
29760	371348	Roger, Buzz. Stand by.	CC
29761	371415	Tranquility, Houston. We'd like you to recall P57 and run through the gravity align one more time. Over.	CC
29762	371424	Roger. I concur with that.	LMPTRAN
29763	371426	Roger, Tranquility. For the mission timer, two suggestions. Set the circuit breaker, panel 11; also reset and attempt to start. That nine in the first digit might have something to do with it. Over.	CC
29764	371445	Okay. We've tried both of those. If the circuit breaker is in when I reset the - put it in RESET, I get 902 04 40. When I release it now, I get 902 04 49. I'm going to cycle the circuit breaker.	CDRTRAN
29765	371468	Roger.	CC

29769	371507	Okay.	CDRTRAN
29770	371564	I'd say the color of the - The local surface is very comparable to that we observed from orbit at this Sun angle, about 10 degrees Sun angle, or that nature. It's pretty much without color. It's gray, and it's a very white, chalky gray, as you look into the zero phase line; and it's considerably darker gray, more like a ash - ashen gray as you look out 90 degrees to the Sun. The - Some of the surface rocks in close here that have been fractured or disturbed by the rocket engine plume are coated with this light gray on the outside; but where they've been broken, they display a dark - very dark gray interior; and it looks like it could be country basalt.

My glycol evaporator outlet TEMP is up above 50 now, and it's quite comfortable in the cockpit; so we'll talk more about that one later.	CMP
30054	382363	Roger, Columbia. Did you shift into manual control, or did the problem resolve itself under AUTO control? Over.	CC

30071	383780	- - be able to see the LM. Do you have any topographical cue that might help me out here? AUTO optics is tracking between two craters. One of them, as the LM sees it, would be long at 11 o'clock. The other would be short and behind him at 5 o'clock. They're great big old craters - depressions.	CMP
30072	383804	Stand by.	CC
30073	383854	Columbia, this is Houston. The best we can do on topo features is to advise you to look to the west of the irregularly shaped crater, and then work on down to the southwest of it. Over.	CC
30074	383885	Columbia, Houston. Another possibility is the southern rim of the southern of the two oldlooking craters. Over.	CC
30075	383922	Roger, Houston. Columbia ... I kept my eyes glued to the sextant that time hoping I'd get a flash of reflected light off the LM, but I wasn't able to see any of my scan areas that you suggested.	CMP
30076	383936	Roger. On that southern of the old craters, there's a small bright crater on the southern rim. One plot would put him slightly to the west of that small bright crater, about 500 to 1000 feet. Do you see anything down there? Over.	CC
30077	383959	Its going past now, Bruce, but I scanned that area that you are talking about very closely, and no, I did not see anything.	CMP

30081	384033	Columbia, this is Houston. On your LAM 2 map, we'd like to confirm the topographical area in which you were looking on this last period of sightings. As we understand you, you were looking in the vicinity of Papa 7 to November 8. Is that correct? Over.	CC

30089	384216	Roger. We believe you were looking a little too far to the west and south. Over.	CC
30090	384243	Roger. Understand. I was looking where auto optics was tracking, on the average, and understand that it should have been more to the north and more to the west; actually a tiny bit outside the circle, huh?	CMP
30091	384257	More to the north and a little more to the east. The feature that I was describing to you, the small bright crater on the rim of the large, fairly old crater, would be about Mike 0.8 and 8.2. Over.	CC
30092	384280	Well, just give me your best estimate as to his location and his coordinate system, and I'll plot it on my map and go from there.	CMP

30103	384706	Yes. The latitude and longitude over 2, 799 and 11730 are the ones that I been using in P22. But what I'm interested in is - is grid coordinates on that map we're using.	CMP
30104	384721	Roger. We'll have them for you in a second.	CC
30105	384728	Thank you.	CMP
30106	384784	Houston, Columbia. Could you enable the S band relay at least one way from Eagle to Columbia so I can hear what's going on?	CMP

30151	385813	Go ahead.	CMP
30152	385815	On your next pass, Columbia, rather than performing a P22 as such, we would like you to look in the vicinity of the coordinates that we gave you, which is our best analysis based on map physics and the trajectory, and we also have another set of coordinates that we would like you to search in the vicinity of. This last one being based on all interpretation of the geological features that were seen by the crew on their way down. The coordinates of this second site are Mike 0.7 and 8.0.

30153	385868	Roger. Copy. Mike 0.7 and 8.0. The only thing is, my best tool for looking is the sextant and if I'm going to crank the sextant up, I might as well let P22 go at the same time, or don't you think so?	CMP
30154	385884	Roger. If you want to go that way, crank it up and then you can drive it around and look where you want. Over.	CC
30155	385893	Okay.	CMP
30156	385895	And if you can find the LM, then by all means, track it or make a note of where it was and we	CC

30166	386400	Okay. Understand, Bruce. Thank you very much.	CMP

30549	393533	Yes. Got it.	CDRTRAN
30550	393556	Okay. Houston, I'm on the porch.	CDRTRAN
30551	393560	Roger, Neil.	CC
30552	393576	Okay. Stand by, Neil.	LMPTRAN
30553	393577	Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. One minute and 30 seconds to LOS. All systems GO. Over.	CC
30554	393586	Columbia. Thank you.	CMP
30555	393587	Stay where you are a minute, Neil.	LMPTRAN
30556	393588	Okay. Need a little slack?	CDRTRAN
30557	393638	You need more slack, Buzz?	CDRTRAN
30558	393640	No. Hold it just a minute.	LMPTRAN
30559	393641	Okay.	CDRTRAN
30560	393656	Okay. Everything's nice and straight in here.	LMPTRAN
30561	393658	Okay. Can you pull the door open a little more?	CDRTRAN
30562	393660	All right.	LMPTRAN
30563	390063	Okay.	CDRTRAN
30564	393667	Did you get the MESA out?	LMPTRAN
30565	393669	I'm going to pull it now.	CDRTRAN
30566	393678	Houston, the MESA came down all right.	CDRTRAN
30567	393682	This is Houston, Roger. We copy. And we're standing by for your TV.	CC
30568	393699	Houston, this is Neil. Radio check.	CDRTRAN
30569	393702	Neil, this is Houston. Loud and clear. Break. Break. Buzz, this is Houston. Radio check, and verify TV circuit breaker in.	CC
30570	393714	Roger, TV circuit breaker's in, and read you five square.	LMPTRAN
30571	393720	Roger. We're getting a picture on the TV.	CC
30572	393729	You got a good picture, huh?	LMPTRAN
30573	393731	There's a great deal of contrast in it, and currently it's upside down on our monitor, but we can make out a fair amount of detail.	CC
30574	393748	Okay. Will you verify the position - the opening I ought to have on the camera?	LMPTRAN
30575	393754	Stand by.	CC
30576	393768	Okay. Neil, we can see you coming down the ladder now.	CC
30577	393779	Okay. I just checked getting back up to that first step, Buzz. It's - not even collapsed too far, but it's adequate to get back up.	CDRTRAN
30578	393790	Roger. We copy.	CC
30579	393791	It takes a pretty good little jump.	CDRTRAN
30580	393815	Okay.	LMPTRAN
30581	393818	I'm at the foot of the ladder. The LM footpads are only depressed in the surface about 1 or 2 inches, although the surface appears to be very, very fine grained, as you get close to it. It's almost like a powder. Down there, it's very fine.	CDRTRAN
30582	393823	I'm going to step off the LM now.	CDRTRAN
30583	393888	THAT'S ONE SMALL STEP FOR (A) MAN, ONE GIANT LEAP FOR MANKIND.	CDRTRAN
30584	393888	And the - the surface is fine and powdery. I can - I can pick it up loosely with my toe. It does adhere in fine layers like powdered charcoal to the sole and sides of my boots. I only go in a small fraction of an inch, maybe an eighth of an inch, but I can see the footprints of my boots and the treads in the fine, sandy particles.	CDRTRAN
30585	393930	Neil, this is Houston. We're copying.	CC
30586	393945	There seems to be no difficulty in moving around as we suspected. It's even perhaps easier than the simulations at one sixth g that we performed in the various simulations on the ground. It's actually no trouble to walk around. Okay. The descent engine did not leave a crater of any size. It has about 1 foot clearance on the ground. We're essentially on a very level place here. I can see some evidence of rays emanating from the descent engine, but a very insignificant amount.	CDREVA
30587	394014	Okay, Buzz, we ready to bring down the camera?	CDREVA
30588	394019	I'm all ready. I think it's been all squared away and in good shape.	LMPEVA
30589	394023	Okay.	CDREVA
30590	394025	Okay. You'll have to pay out all the LEC. It looks like it's coming out nice and evenly.	LMPEVA
30591	394033	Okay. It's quite dark here in the shadow and a little hard for me to see that I have good footing. I'll work my way over into the sunlight here without looking directly into the Sun.	CDREVA
30592	394048	Okay. It's taut now.	LMPEVA
30593	394071	Okay. I think you're pulling the wrong one.	LMPEVA
30594	394075	I'm just - Okay. I'm ready to pull it down now. There was still a little bit left in the -	CDREVA
30595	394081	Okay. Don't hold it quite so tight.	LMPEVA
30596	394082	Okay.	CDREVA
30597	394097	Looking up at the LM, I'm standing directly in tne shadow now looking up at Buzz in the window. And I can see everything quite clearly. The light is sufficiently bright backlighted into the front of the LM, that everything is very clearly visible,	CDREVA
30598	394135	Okay. I'm going to be changing the ***	LMPEVA
30599	394138	Okay.	CDREVA
30600	394223	The camera is installed on the RCU bracket, and I'm storing the LEC on the secondary strut.	CDREVA
30601	394253	I'll step out and take some of my first pictures here.	CDREVA
30602	394265	Roger. Neil, we're reading you loud and clear. We see you getting some pictures and the contingency sample.	CC
30603	394339	Neil, this is Houston. Did you copy about the contingency sample? Over.	CC
30604	394346	Roger. I'm going to get to that just as soon as I finish these picture series.	CDREVA
30605	394405	Okay. Going to get the contingency sample there, Neil.	LMPEVA
30606	394407	Right.	CDREVA
30607	394410	Okay. That's good.	LMPEVA
30608	394438	Okay. The contingency sample is down and it's ***. Looks like it's a little difficult to dig through the initial crust.	LMPEVA
30609	394452	This is very interesting. It's a very soft surface, but here and there where I plug with the contingency sample collector, I run into a very hard surface, but it appears to be very cohesive material of the same sort. I'll try to get a rock in here. Just a couple.	CDREVA
30610	394494	That looks beautiful from here, Neil.	LMPEVA
30611	394496	It has a stark beauty all its own. It's like much of the high desert of the United States. It's different but it's very pretty out here. Be advised that a lot of the rock samples out here, the hard rock samples, have what appear to be vesicles in the surface. Also, I am looking at one now that appears to have some sort of phenocryst.	CDREVA
30612	394530	Houston. Roger. Out.	CC
30613	394543	Okay. The handle is off the *** in about 6 or 8 inches into the surface. I could *** easy ***.	LMPEVA
30614	394556	Yes, it is. it's - I'm sure I could push it in farther, but it's hard for me to bend down further than that.	CDREVA
30615	394567	Now, you can throw so far.	LMPEVA
30616	394568	You can really throw things a long way up here.	CDREVA
30617	394592	That pocket open, Buzz?	CDREVA
30618	394595	Yes, it is. It's not up against your suit though. Hit it back once more. More toward the inside. Okay. That's good.	LMPEVA
30619	394597	That in the pocket?	CDREVA
30620	394602	Yes. Push down.	LMPEVA
30621	394615	Got it?	CDREVA
30622	394617	No. It's not all the way in. Push it. There you go.	LMPEVA
30623	394628	Contingency sample is in the pocket. My oxygen is 81 percent. I have no flags, and I'm in minimum flow.	CDREVA
30624	394642	This is Houston. Roger, Neil.	CC
30625	394660	Okay. I have got the cameras on at one frame a second.	LMPEVA
30626	394664	Okay.	CDREVA
30627	394672	And I've got the 80 percent, no flags.	LMPEVA
30628	394680	Are you getting a TV picture now, Houston?	CDREVA
30629	394685	Neil, yes we are getting a TV picture.	CC
30630	394702	Neil, this is Houston. We're getting a picture. You're not in it at the present time. We can see the bag on the LEC being moved by Buzz, though. Here you come into our field of view.	CC
30631	394713	...	CDREVA
30632	394715	Roger.	LMPEVA
30633	394716	Hold it a second. First let me move that over the edge for you.	CDREVA
30634	394721	Okay. Are you ready for me to come out?	LMPEVA
30635	394722	Yes. Just stand by a second. I'll move this over the handrail.	CDREVA
30636	394746	Okay.	CDREVA
30637	394747	All right. That's got it. Are you ready?	LMPEVA
30638	394751	All set. Okay. You saw what difficulties I was having. I'll try to watch your PLSS from underneath here.	CDREVA
30639	394783	All right. The backup camera's positioned.	LMPEVA
30640	394797	Okay. Your PLSS is - Looks like it is clearing okay. Your toes are about to come over the sill. Okay. Now drop your PLSS down. There you go; you're clear. And laterally you're good. You've got an inch clearance on top of your PLSS.	CDREVA
30641	394818	Okay. You need a little bit of arching of the back to come down. ... How are are my feet from the edge?	LMPEVA
30642	394827	Okay. You're right at the edge of the porch.	CDREVA
30643	394830	Okay. Back in *** little of foot movement *** porch. Little arching of the back. Helmet comes up and clears the bulkhead without any trouble at all.	LMPEVA
30644	394848	Looks good.	CDREVA
30645	394868	Neil, this is Houston. Based on your camera transfer with the LEC, do you foresee any difficulties in SRC transfer? Over.	CC
30646	394878	Negative.	CDREVA
30647	394888	Okay. Now I want to back up and partially close the hatch.	LMPEVA
30648	394907	Making sure not to lock it on my way Â¢ut.	LMPEVA
30649	394913	(Laughter) A pretty good thought.	CDREVA
30650	394916	That's our home for the next couple of hours and we want to take good care of it. Okay. I'm on the top step and I can look down over the RCU, landing gear pads. It's a very simple matter to hop down from one step to the next.	LMPEVA
30651	394938	Yes. I found I could be very comfortable, and walking is also very comfortable.	CDREVA
30652	394948	You've got three more steps and then a long one.	CDREVA
30653	394962	Okay. I'm going to leave that one foot up there and both hands down to about the fourth rung up.	LMPEVA
30654	394970	There you go.	CDREVA
30655	394973	Okay. Now I think I'll do the same ***	LMPEVA
30656	394981	A little more. About another inch.	CDREVA
30657	394985	THERE YOU GOT IT.	CDREVA
30658	394988	That's a good step. About a 3-footer.	CDREVA
30659	394996	Beautiful view!	LMPEVA
30660	394998	Isn't that something! Magnificent sight out here.	CDREVA
30661	395004	Magnificent desolation.	LMPEVA
30662	395027	Looks like the secondary strut *** little thermal effects on it right here, Neil.	LMPEVA
30663	395034	Yes. I noticed that. That seems to be the worst, although similar effects are on - all around.	CDREVA
30664	395047	... powder, isn't it?	MS
30665	395049	Isn't it fine?	CDREVA
30666	395051	Right in this area I don't think there's much of any *** fine powder *** clods together, and it's hard to tell whether it's a clod or a rock.	LMPEVA
30667	395063	Notice how you can kick it out.	CDREVA
30668	395068	Yes. And it bounces and then -	LMPEVA
30669	395095	Reaching down is fairly easy. I got my suit dirty at this stage.	LMPEVA
30670	395111	The mass of the backpack does have some effect in inertia.	LMPEVA
30671	395130	There's a slight tendency, I can see now, to *** backwards *** due to the soft, very soft texture.	LMPEVA
30672	395145	You're standing on a rock, a big rock there now.	CDREVA
30673	395161	This pad sure didn't ***	LMPEVA
30674	395165	No. It didn't.	CDREVA
30675	395168	There's absolutely no crater there at all from the engine.	LMPEVA
30676	395170	No.	CDREVA
30677	395172	I wonder if about right under the engine is where the probe might have hit.	LMPEVA
30678	395180	I'd like that.	CDREVA
30679	395185	Yes. I think that's a good representation of our sideward velocity at touchdown there - hole at the probe.	CDREVA
30680	395190	I see that probe over on the minus-Y strut. It's broken off and bent back up.	LMPEVA
30681	395200	It did, didn't it? The other two both bent over.	CDREVA
30682	395224	Can't say too much for the visibility right here without the visor up. It's dark. It looks like there is a *** surface of it is *** pounded rock *** And incidentally, these rocks *** very powdery surface ***	LMPEVA
30683	395260	Say again, please, Buzz; you're cutting out.	CC
30684	395265	I say that the rocks are rather slippery.	LMPEVA
30685	395270	Roger.	CC
30686	395272	A powdery surface when the sun hits. *** they split up all the very little fine porouses *** Will tend to slide over it rather easily.	LMPEVA
30687	395305	Traction *** seems quite good. ***	LMPEVA
30688	395310	*** About to lose my balance in one direction and recovery is a quite natural and very easy *** And, moving your arms around, Jack, doesn't *** off the surface *** not quite that light-footed.	LMPEVA
30689	395346	And, I have the insulation off the MESA now and MESA seems to be in good shape.	CDREVA
30690	395353	Got to be careful that you are leaning in the direction you want to go, otherwise you *** slightly inebriated. In other words, you have to cross your foot over to stay underneath where your center-of-mass is.	LMPEVA
30691	395377	And, Neil, didn't I say we might see some purple rocks?	LMPEVA
30692	395382	Find a purple rock?	CDREVA
30693	395384	Yes. They are small, sparkly *** fragments *** places *** would make a first guess that some sort of biotite *** We'll leave that to further analysis ***	LMPEVA
30694	395428	*** compact underneath *** completely no *** you don't sink down more than ... a quarter of an inch.	LMPEVA
30695	395459	Okay, Houston. I'm going to change lenses on you.	CDREVA
30696	395465	Roger, Neil.	CC
30697	395490	Okay, Houston. Tell me if you're getting a new picture.	CDREVA
30698	395495	Neil, this is Houston. That's affirmative. We're getting a new picture. You can tell it's a longer focal length lens. And for your information, all LM systems are GO. Over.	CC
30699	395506	We appreciate that. Thank you.	LMPEVA
30700	395539	Neil is now unveiling the plaque *** gear.	LMPEVA
30701	395547	Roger. We got you boresighted, but back under one track.	CC
30702	395560	For those who haven't read the plaque, we'll read the plaque that's on the front landing gear of this LM. First there's two hemispheres, one showing each of the two hemispheres of the Earth. Underneath it says "Here Man from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon, July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind." It has the crew members' signatures and the signature of the President of the United States.	CDREVA
30703	395615	Ready for the camera?	CDREVA
30704	395618	No. I'll get it. No, you take this TV on out.	LMPEVA
30705	395625	Watch the LEC, there.	CDREVA
30706	395633	Now I'm afreid these ... materials are going to get dusty ***	LMPEVA
30707	395647	The surface material is powdery. *** How good your lens is, but if you can *** smudges ... very much like a very finely powdered carbon, but it's very pretty looking.	LMPEVA
30708	395680	Would you pull out some of my cable for me, Buzz?	CDREVA
30709	395698	Houston. How close are you able to get things in focus ?	LMPEVA
30710	395702	This is Houston. We can see Buzz's right hand. It is somewhat out of focus. I'd say we were focusing down to probably - oh, about 8 inches to a foot behind the position of his hand when he was pulling out the cable.	CC
30711	395721	Okay. How's the temperature on there?	LMPEVA
30712	395725	Temperature of the camera is showing zero.	CDREVA
30713	395732	I'm a little cool. I think I'll trade ***	LMPEVA
30714	395743	I'm on intermediate now, Houston, and I show 3.78. No flags, 70 ***	LMPEVA
30715	395750	Houston. Roger. Out.	CC
30716	395757	And, we'll probably need a little *** distance *** back location *** television camera.	LMPEVA
30717	395774	Neil, look at the minus Y-strut, the direction of travel there *** travel from right to left.	LMPEVA
30718	395784	Right.	CDREVA
30719	395785	This one over here underneath the ascent engine where the probe first hit - the minus-Y probe first hit.	LMPEVA
30720	395795	I got plenty of cable?	CDREVA
30721	395798	You've got plenty. Plenty more.	LMPEVA
30722	395808	Okay. I think I've got the end of it.	LMPEVA
30723	395811	Something interesting: in the bottom of this little crater here - It may be -	CDREVA
30724	395821	Now keep going. We've got a lot more.	LMPEVA
30725	395823	Okay.	CDREVA
30726	395824	Getting a little harder to pull out, here.	LMPEVA
30727	395850	How far would you say I am, Buzz?	CDREVA
30728	395853	Forty, 50 feet. Why don't you turn around and let them get a view from there and see what the field of view looks like?	LMPEVA
30729	395862	Okay.	CDREVA
30730	395865	You're backing into the cable.	LMPEVA
30731	395866	Okay.	CDREVA
30732	395870	Turn around to your right, would be better.	LMPEVA
30733	395873	I don't want to go into the Sun if I can avoid it.	CDREVA
30734	395875	That's right. Yes.	LMPEVA
30735	395879	I'll just leave it - -	CDREVA
30736	395881	- - All right.	LMPEVA
30737	395882	- - sit like that and walk around it.	CDREVA
30738	395886	Houston. How's that field of view going to pick up the MESA? *** far away?	LMPEVA
30739	395895	Roger.	CC
30740	395900	Neil, this is Houston. The field of view is okay. We'd like you to aim it a little bit more to the right. Over.	CC
30741	395908	Okay.	CDREVA
30742	395912	Okay. That's all the cable we have. *** not going out. I'll start working on the solar wind - -	LMPEVA
30743	395920	A little bit too much to the right. Can you bring it back left about 4 or 5 Degrees?	CC
30744	395930	Okay. That looks good Neil.	CC
30745	395935	Okay, now. Do you think I ought to be farther away, or closer?	CDREVA
30746	395941	Can't get too much further away.	LMPEVA
30747	395945	Let's try it like that for a while. I'll get a couple of panoramas with it, here.	CDREVA
30748	395953	Roger. You look okay as far as distance goes, Neil. And we'll line you up again when you finish the panorama. Now you're going too fast on the panorama sweep. You're going to have to stop, or -	CC
30749	395968	I haven't stopped - I haven't set it down yet. That's the first picture in the panorama. Right there.	CDREVA
30750	395975	Roger.	CC
30751	395980	It's taken just a little - about north, north east.	CDREVA
30752	395992	Tell me if you've got a picture, Houston.	CDREVA
30753	395994	We've got a beautiful picture, Neil.	CC
30754	395998	Okay. I'm going to move it.	CDREVA
30755	396010	Okay. Here's another good one.	CC
30756	396023	Okay, we got that one.	CC
30757	396029	Okay. Now, this one is right down front, straight west. And I want to know if you can see an angular rock in the foreground.	CDREVA
30758	396041	Roger. We have a large angular rock in the foreground, and it looks like a much smaller rock a couple of inches to the left of it. Over.	CC
30759	396052	All right. And then on beyond it about 10 feet is an even larger rock that's very rounded. That rock is about - The closest one to you is about sticking out of the sand about 1 foot. And it's about a foot and one half long, and it's about 6 inches thick, but it's standing on edge.	CDREVA
30760	396076	Roger.	CC
30761	396086	Okay, Neil. I've got the table out and the bag deployed.	LMPEVA
30762	396093	We've got this view, Neil.	CC
30763	396102	This is straight south.	CDREVA
30764	396105	Roger. And we see the shadow of the LM.	CC
30765	396108	Roger. The little hill just beyond the shadow of the LM is a pair of elongate craters about - probably the pair together is about 40 feet long and 20 feet across, and they're probably 6 feet deep. We'll probably get some more work in there later.	CDREVA
30766	396140	Roger. We see Buzz going about his work.	CC
30767	396142	How's that for a final?	CDREVA

30809	396817	You are in our field of view now.	CC
30810	396822	Okay. You do have to be rather careful to keep track of where your center of mass is. Sometimes, it takes about two or three paces to make sure you've got your feet underneath you.	LMPEVA
30811	396845	About two to three or maybe four easy paces can bring you to a nearly smooth stop. *** change directions, like a football player, you just have to to *** foot out to the side and cut a little bit.	LMPEVA
30812	396878	So called kangeroo hop does work, but it seems that your forward mobility is not quite as good as - it is in the conventional - more conventional one foot after another.	LMPEVA
30813	396906	It's hard saying what a sane pace might be. I think it's the one that I'm using now - would get rather tiring after several hundred *** but this may be a function of this suit, as well as lack of gravity forces.	LMPEVA

I just cant tell you how proud we all are of what you *** for every American. This has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they, too, join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of mans world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one; one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.

30844	397463	Roger. I'll try that.	LMPEVA
30845	397465	Beautiful.	CC
30846	397470	Well, I had that one inside my mouth that time.	LMPEVA
30847	397475	It sounded a little wet.	CC
30848	397509	In general, time spent in the shadow doesn't seem to have any *** thermal effects. *** inside the suit. There is a difference, of course, in the ... radiation and the helmet. So I think there's a tendency to feel a little cooler in the shadow than the Sun.	LMPEVA

30860	397908	And right in this area, there are two craters. The one that's right in front of me now as I look off in about the eleven o'clock position from the spacecraft, about 30 to 35 feet ... There's several eral rocks and boulders 6 to 8 inches across ... sizes.	LMPEVA

30886	398613	Did you get it?	LMPEVA
30887	398630	Houston, how does our timeline appear to be going?	CDREVA
30888	398635	Roger. It looks like you're about a half hour slow on it. We're working on consumables. Over.	CC
30889	398643	All right.	CDREVA
30890	398685	Neil and Buzz, this is Houston. To clarify my last, your consumables are in good shape at this time. The 30 minute reference was with respect to the nominal timeline. Over.	CC
30891	398703	Roger. I understand that.	CDREVA
30892	398796	I don't note any abnormalities in the LM. The pods seem to be in good shape. The primary and secondary struts are in good shape. Atennas are all in place. There's no evidence of problem underneath the LM due to engine exhaust or drainage of any kind.	CDREVA
30893	398837	Roger. Out.	CC
30894	398838	It's very surprising, the very surprising lack of penetration of all four of the foot pads. I'd say if we were to try and determine just how far below the surface they would have penetrated, you'd measure maybe 3 inches, wouldn't you say, Neil?	LMPEVA
30895	398857	At the most, yes. That Y strut there is probably even less than that.	CDREVA
30896	398875	Nice paint job.	LMPEVA
30897	398884	I get a picture of the plus Y strut taken from near the descent stage, and I think we'll be able to see a little bit better what the thermal effects are. Seem to be quite minimal.	LMPEVA
30898	398928	There's one picture taken in the right rear of the spacecraft looking at the skirt of the descent stage, shows a quite darkening of the surface color, a rather minimal amount of radiating or etching away or erosion of the surface. 0n descent, both of us remarked that we could see a large amount of very fine dust particles moving out. It was reported beforehand that we would probably see an upgassing from the surface after actual engine shutdown, but as I recall, I was unable to confirm that.	LMPEVA
30899	399026	This is too big an angle, Neil.	LMPEVA
30900	399034	Yes. I think you are right.	CDREVA
30901	399089	We're back at the minus Z strut now. *** very little force of impact that we actually had.	LMPEVA
30902	399121	And, Neil, if you'll take the camera, I'll get to work on the SEQ bay.	LMPEVA
30903	399125	Okay.	CDREVA
30904	399127	Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. I notice that -	CC
30905	399136	Go ahead, Buzz.	CC

30907	399147	I was saying that, Houston, *** stop and take a photograph or something and then want to start moving again sideways, there's quite a tendency to start doing it with just gradual sideways hops until you start getting ***	LMPEVA
30908	399167	Roger.	CC
30909	399177	Can you see us underneath the LM over at the SEQ bay, Houston?	LMPEVA
30910	399180	Yes indeed, Buzz. We can see your feet sticking our underneath the structure of the LM descent stage.	CC
30911	399188	Okay. I'm just on the other side of the - -	LMPEVA
30912	399193	Now we can see you through the structure of the minus Z secondary strut.	CC
30913	399218	All right. The doors are open, and it looks like they are going to stay up without any problem.	LMPEVA
30914	399226	Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. We are about to lose you on the OMNI's. Request high gain antenna, REACQ mode Fish 20, yaw 135. Over.	CC
30915	399243	You want to pick an area, Neil?	LMPEVA
30916	399245	Make that yaw 175, Columbia, yaw 175 on the high gain.	CC
30917	399254	Columbia is locked up on the high gain, Houston.	CMP

30921	399390	And the manual deployment of the LR cubed, the little spring that is at the end of the string is pulled off of the picks head. However, I was able to reach up and get hold of the picks head and pull it loose. So, it will be deployed manually, also.	LMPEVA
30922	399411	Roger.	CC
30923	399425	And, the panorama is complete. *** and the LM - got the LM at 7 30 position at about 60 feet.	CDREVA

30926	399470	Have you got us a good area picked out?	LMPEVA
30927	399473	Yes. I think right out on that rise out there is probably as good as any.	CDREVA
30928	399488	I'll probably stay on the high ground there and - -	CDREVA
30929	399496	Watch it; the edge of that crater is - drops - -	LMPEVA
30930	399499	Yes. It drops off there, doesn't it?	CDREVA
30931	399504	Get a couple of close ups on these quite rounded large boulders.	LMPEVA
30932	399524	About 40 feet out - I'd say out at the end of that next - -	CDREVA
30933	399530	It's going to be a little difficult to find a good level spot here.	LMPEVA
30934	399535	The top of that next little ridge there. Wouldn't that be a pretty good place?	CDREVA
30935	399543	All right. Should I put the LR cubed right about here?	LMPEVA
30936	399547	All right.	CDREVA
30937	399550	I'm going to have to get on the other side of this rock here.	LMPEVA
30938	399559	I would go right around that crater to the left there. Isn't that a level spot there?	CDREVA
30939	399565	I think this right here is just as level.	LMPEVA
30940	399600	These boulders look like basalt, and they have probably 2 percent white minerals in them, the white crystals. And the thing that I reported as the vesicular before, I'm not - I don't believe I believe that any more. I think that small craters - they look like little impact craters where shot - B B shot has hit the surface.	CDREVA
30941	399728	Houston. I have the seismic experiment flipped over now, and I'm aligning it, but I'm having a little bit of difficulty getting the B B in the center. It wants to move around and around on the outside. ***	LMPEVA
30942	399754	You're cutting out again, Buzz.	CC
30943	399769	Roger. I say I'm not having too much success in leveling the PSE experiment.	LMPEVA
30944	399837	The laser reflector is installed and the bubble is leveled and the alignment appears to be good.	CDREVA
30945	399856	Neil, this is Houston. Roger. Out.	CC
30946	399863	Hey, you want to take a look at this B B and see what you make out of it?	LMPEVA
30947	399870	I find it pretty hard to get perfectly level, too.	CDREVA
30948	399877	That B B likes the outside. It won't go on the inside.	LMPEVA
30949	399888	That little cup is convex now, instead of concave.	CDREVA
30950	399893	I think you're right.	LMPEVA
30951	399896	Believe it is.	CDREVA
30952	399897	Houston, I don't think there's any hope for using this leveling device to come up with an accurate level. It looks to me as though the cup here that the B B is in is now convex instead of concave. Over.	LMPEVA
30953	399919	Roger, 11. Press on. If you think it looks level by eyeball, go ahead.	CC
30954	399928	Okay.	LMPEVA
30955	399963	...	CDREVA
30956	399980	There you go. Good work; good show. Hey, whoa; stop, stop! Back up.	CDREVA
30957	399994	Houston, as I was spacing the PSE, the right hand solar array deployed automatically. The left hand I had to manually *** the bar at the far end.	LMPEVA
30958	400016	All parts of the solar array are clear of the ground now.	LMPEVA
30959	400022	Buzz, this is Houston. I understand that you did successfully deploy both solar arrays. Over.	CC
30960	400030	Roger. That's affirmative. And there isn't any way of telling whether that's lined up. I'm getting in the way; maybe I can get down here.	LMPEVA
30961	400058	Neil, how does that appear to be pointing?	LMPEVA
30962	400088	Neil, this is Houston. Over.	CC
30963	400093	Go ahead, Houston.	CDREVA
30964	400095	Roger. We've been looking at your consumables, and you're in good shape. Subject to your concurrence, we'd like to extend the duration of the EVA 15 minutes from nominal. We will still give Buzz a hack at 10 minutes for heading in. Your current elapsed time is 2 plus 12. Over.	CC
30965	400125	Okay. That sounds fine.	CDREVA
30966	400127	Roger. Out.	CC
30967	400147	Buzz, this is Houston. If you're still in the vicinity of the PSE, could you get a photograph of the ball level? Over.	CC
30968	400156	I'll do that, Buzz.	CDREVA
30969	400158	Right. We'll get a photograph of that. Houston, what time would you estimate we could allow for the documented sample? Over.	LMPEVA
30970	400183	Oh, shoot. Would you believe the ball is right in the middle now?	CDREVA
30971	400190	Wonderful. Take a picture before it moves.	LMPEVA

31000	400739	Houston, were you able to record the documentary way where the two core tube samples were taken?	LMPEVA
31001	400752	Negative. Out.	CC
31002	400759	I didn't get a stereopair of those two, but they are right in the vicinity of the solar wind.	CDREVA
31003	400769	Neil, this is Houston. After you've got the core tubes and the solar wind, anything else that you can throw into the box would be acceptable.	CC

31063	401636	Okay. I've got one side hooked up to the second box and I've got the film pack on.	CDREVA
31064	401641	Okay. Good.	LMPEVA
31065	401660	Boy, that bilge from on the LEC is kind of falling all over me while I'm doing this.	CDREVA
31066	401670	All that soot, huh?	LMPEVA
31067	401676	That's what it looks like down here.	CDREVA
31068	401683	I think my watch stopped, Neil.	LMPEVA

31205	406193	This is Houston. We copy. And, for your information, the new LM weight after jettison of equipment including lithium hydroxide canister is 10837. Over.	CC
31206	406211	Okay. 10837.	CDRTRAN
31207	406396	Houston, Columbia. Did you copy the P52?	CMP

31209	406419	Okay.	CMP
31210	406505	Tranquility Base, this is Houston. In the flight plan configuration, we show that the stability control circuit breaker ATCA on panel 16 should be open at this time. Over.	CC

31215	406588	Housquin - Houston, Tranquility. Do you have a way of showing the configuration of the engine arm circuit breaker? Over. The reason I'm asking is because the end of it appears to be broken off. I think we can push it back in again. I'm not sure we could pull it out if we pushed it in, though. Over.	LMPTRAN
31216	406616	Roger. We copy. Stand by please.	CC
31217	406641	Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Our telemetry shows the engine arm circuit breaker in the OPEN position at the present time. We want you to leave it open until it is nominally scheduled to be pushed in, which is later on. Over.	CC
31218	406661	Roger. Copy.	LMPTRAN

31230	407525	Roger, Mike. Couple of quick flight plan update here. First off, we'd like to get an O2 fuel cell purge at time 113 30. You - Are you copying? Over.	CC
31231	407543	Roger. And copy.	CMP
31232	407546	Secondly, we will return to the nominal timeline with your scheduled wakeup of 121 hours and 12 minutes. We sort of slipped by lithium hydroxide canister change number 9 during the EVA and EVA PREP. We'd like you to accomplish that now. The COMM for sleep will be the normal lunar COMM configuration, the RCS configuration. We're requesting you use quads Alfa and Bravo. A DAP data load for R2 should be 01111. Readback. Over.	CC
31233	407608	Roger. Oxygen fuel cell purge at 113 30. Return to the nominal timeline at 121 hours wakeup. Lithium hydroxide change number 9 right now. Normal lunar COMM sleep configuration, I'm in that now. On the RCS, I understood before you wanted to load the DAP register 2 011000 which made sense, and then later to pitch only	CMP
31234	407720	Columbia. This is Houston. On your DAP load in R2, we're requesting a 0 an four 1's, that is, 01111. Over	CC
31235	407734	Okay.	CMP
31236	407738	And you - -	CC
31237	407739	Load's going in right now.	CMP
31238	407741	Roger. And you'll be enabling quads Alfa and Bravo on the AUTO RCS select switches. Disable Charlie and Delta.	CC
31239	407751	All right.	CMP
31240	407759	And we have a little less than 2 minutes to LOS. If you're still up, AOS next time around will be 114 04. Over.	CC
31241	407778	Roger.	CMP

On your next depressurization, it's acceptable to use the overhead hatch dump valve in addition to or instead of the forward hatch dump valve to speed up the depressurization of the cabin. I have a T13 update for you, and if you could, sometime here, give us P00 and DATA; we'll uplink you a new CSM state vector. Over.	CC

31268	410426	Roger.	CC
31269	410428	It was great.	LMPTRAN
31270	410430	Sure wish you'd hurry up and get that trash out out of there, though.	CC

31277	410748	Okay. Sounds fine.	CMP
31278	410750	And we're going to power down the voice subcarrier part of our uplink to you in order that we don't disturb you while we're talking to Tranquility Base. If you need us, just give us	CC
31279	410773	Okay. Thank you.	CMP

31281	410780	Good night, Bruce. Thanks a lot.	CMP
31282	410963	Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. We'd like you to ENABLE the thrusters in Bravo 1 and Bravo 2, AUTO RCS SELECT. Over.	CC

31284	410989	Roger. Out.	CC
31285	411018	Tranquility, this is Houston. For a reference, which dump valve are you using? Over.	CC

31292	411531	No, indeed.	CC
31293	411688	Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Over.	CC
31294	411694	Go ahead, Houston.	CDRTRAN
31295	411696	Roger. When you get back into your surface checklist and come over to the COMM reconfiguration on page Surface 45, we'd like you to enable the ranging feature on your S band. That is, when you come down to S band configuration, instead of CAUTION and WARNING ELECTRONICS, ENABLE TV, we'd like you to go into the RANGE position and leave it there for as long as you conveniently can until you get ready to commence your rest period; and we'll try to get a little more ranging data on you. Over.	CC
31296	411740	Roger. Copy.	CDRTRAN
31297	411743	And of course, when you get ready to turn in, go back into caution and warning, ENABLE, and we'd like to say from all of us down here in Houston and really from all of us in all the countries and in the entire world, we think that you've done a magnificent job up there today. Over.	CC
31298	411766	Thank you very much.	CDRTRAN
31299	411768	It's been a long day.	LMPTRAN
31300	411771	Yes, indeed. Get some rest there and have at it tomorrow.	CC
31301	411846	Houston, Tranquility. Did you all come up with any other solution that we might try to the mission timer problem? Over.	LMPTRAN
31302	411867	Stand by, Tranquility. We'll be back with you in just a minute.	CC
31303	411929	And, Houston, Tranquility. Have you had enough TV for today?	LMPTRAN
31304	411934	Tranquility, this is Houston. Yes, indeed. It's been a mighty fine presentation there.	CC
31305	411943	Okay. Signing off. See you again tomorrow.	LMPTRAN
31306	411946	Roger.	CC
31307	412013	Columbia, Colunbia, this is Houston. Over.	CC
31308	412020	Go ahead, Houston.	CMP
31309	412022	Roger. Sorry to bother you, Columbia. Two things: we request that you select 10 degree deadband in your DAP in accordance with the procedures on Foxtrot 9 7 in your checklist; and secondly, we'd like to leave a display on the DSKY that is not one that's cycling, being continuously updated. What you have when you get through widening the deadband will be a static display, and that'll be satisfactory. Over.	CC
31310	412061	Okay.	CMP
31311	412062	Roger. Goodnight again.	CC
31312	412089	Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Over.	CC
31313	412096	Roger. Go ahead.	LMPTRAN
31314	412099	Roger. On your mission timer, we wanted to pull the circuit breaker and let it cool down for an hour and a half to 2 hours. I believe the breaker is currently open. It has been off, so go ahead and reset the mission timer circuit breaker. Put the timer control to RESET and hold it in RESET for 30 seconds, and then slew it to your desired settings left to right, and place the timer control to START. Over.	CC
31315	412144	Okay. We'll try it.	LMPTRAN
31316	412195	Houston, our mission timer seems to be slewing okay. You want to give us a time hack? Or can we get it off the CMC LGC, I mean?	CDRTRAN
31317	412223	Roger, Tranquility. I'll give you a time hack at 114 31 00. It's about 30 seconds from now. Over.	CC
31318	412251	Stand by for a Mark at 114 31.	CC
31319	412252	Okay. ... you.	LMPTRAN
31320	412257	Stand by.	CC
31321	412260	MARK.	CC
31322	412274	Tranquility, this is Houston. Did you copy my Mark at 114 31?	CC
31323	412282	Roger. Thank you, and our mission timer is running now.	CDRTRAN
31324	412287	Roger. Very good. And, I've got a consumables update for you if you're ready to copy or listen. Over.	CC
31325	412298	Stand by.	LMPTRAN
31326	412303	Okay. Go ahead.	LMPTRAN
31327	412305	Okay. RCS Alfa is 81 percent, RCS Bravo 75 percent. Coming up on 115 hours GET, descent oxygen is 31.8 pounds or 59 percent; descent amp hours 858, and ascent amp hours 574. Over.	CC
31328	412348	Roger. Copy. Thank you very much.	LMPTRAN
31329	412352	Roger. Out.	CC
31330	412386	Tranquility, this is Houston. We also have a set of about 10 questions relating to observations you made, things you may have seen during the EVA. You can either discuss a little later on this evening or sometime later in the mission at your option. How do you feel? Over.	CC
31331	412415	I guess we can take them up now.	CDRTRAN
31332	412419	Okay. And your friendly Green Team here has pretty well been relieved by your friendly Maroon Team, and I'll put Owen on with the questions.	CC
31333	412432	Tranquility - -	CC
31334	412433	Okay. Thank you, Bruce. Go ahead.	CDRTRAN
31335	412439	Tranquility, Houston. First question here is how your best estimate of the yaw on the - of the LM as compared to the nominal preflight plan. Over.	CC
31336	412456	We got 13 degrees left on the ball, and I think that's probably about right. Looking at the shadow and so on, we prob - probably about 13 degrees left of the shadow.	LMPTRAN
31337	412471	Roger. That's 13 degrees left of the shadow. And, next question relates to the depth of the bulk sampling that you obtained near the first part of the EVA and any changes in composition that you might have observed during the bulk sampling interval. Over.	CC
31338	412502	I'm not sure I understand that question, but we got a good bit of the ground mass in the bulk sample plus a sizable number of selected rock fragments of different types.	CDRTRAN
31339	412522	Roger, Neil. One of the implications here is the depth from which the bulk sample was collected. Did you manage to get down there several inches or nearer the surface? Over.	CC
31340	412537	We got some down from as much as 3 inches in the area where I was looking at variation with depth in the bulk sample. There really wasn't appreciable difference, and I didn't run into any hard bed. Later on, or at some other times and other areas, why, I'd get down just a short distance, an inch or two, and couldn't go any further.	CDRTRAN
31341	412566	Roger. Believe we understand down as deep as 3 inches, did not hit any hard bed, and no significant changes in composition to that depth. Next question, the - the second SRC was packed rather hurriedly due to the time limitation, and wonder if you would be able to provide any more detailed description of the samples which were included in the second SRC. Over.	CC
31342	412600	We got two core tubes and solar wind and about half of the big sample bag full of assorted rocks which I picked up hurriedly from around the area. I tried to get as many representative types as I could.	CDRTRAN
31343	412629	Roger, Neil. Next topic here relates to the rays which emanate from the DPS engine burning area. We're wondering if the rays emanating from the - beneath the engine are any darker or lighter than the surrounding surface. Over.	CC
31344	412662	The ones that I saw back in the aft end of the spacecraft appeared to be a good bit darker; of course, viewed from the aft end, why, they did have the Sun shining directly on them. It seemed as though the material had been baked somewhat and also scattered in a radially outward direction, but in that particular area, this feature didn't extend more than about 2, maybe 3 feet, from the skirt of the engine. Over.	LMPTRAN
31345	412704	Roger. Understand that near the aft end out to the east that the rays did appear darker. I understand, Buzz, that these were - this was the appearance of the material which had been uncovered by the rays that appeared darker for 2 or 3 feet extending outward. Is that correct?	CC
31346	412729	No. I wouldn't say it was necessarily material that had been uncovered. I think some of the material might have been baked or in some way caused to be more cohesive and perhaps flow together in some way, I don't know. Now, in other areas, before we started trampling around out front, why, we could see that small erosion had taken place in a radially outward direction, but it had left no significant mark on the surface other than just having eroded it away. Now, it was different back in the - right under the skirt itself. It seems as though the surface had been baked in a streak fashion, and I think a couple of pictures on film will show this. But that didn't extend out very far. Over.	LMPTRAN
31347	412788	Roger, Tranquility. And this baked appearance that you described, at least the suggestion is that it was due to the heat of the engine at any rate. Next subject, did - -	CC
31348	412801	I believe so.	LMPTRAN
31349	412802	Roger. Next subject, did either of the solar panels on the PSE touch the surface of the Moon during deployment? Over.	CC
31350	412819	I think that two corners did touch, since when it was deployed, both of them didn't come out at the same time. It unfolded a little unevenly, and of course, the terrain that it was on was a little bit - not quite as level as it was - as I would like to have it. And I think that two corners did touch to about 1 inch - no, three quarters to a half an inch deep; and maybe along the bottom, it might have been maybe 3 inches, leaving a small triangular coating on two of the corners; and I think these are on the western ones. Over.	LMPTRAN
31351	412866	Roger. Understand the description there. And the next subject, on the two core tubes which you collected, how did the driving force required to collect these tubes compare? Was there any difference? Over	CC
31352	412887	Not significantly. I could get down to about the first 2 inches without much of a problem, and then as I would pound it in about as hard as I could do it, and the second one took two hands on the hammer, and I was putting pretty good dents in the top of the extension rod, and it just wouldn't go much more than - I think the total depth might have been about 8 or 9 inches. But even there, it didn't - For some reason it didn't seem to want to stand up straight. In other words, I'd keep driving it in and it would dig some sort of a hole but it wouldn't - just penetrate in a way that would support it and keep it from falling over, if that makes any sense at all. It didn't really to me. Over.	LMPTRAN
31353	412942	Roger, Buzz. I think I've got the picture. You indicate that little difference between the two samples and that in each case you got down about 2 inches without any problems and then had to continue hammering rather vigorously in order to continue driving it in to a total depth of 8 or 9 inches, and even at that point the rods did not want to stay vertical, that they'd tend to fall over on you even after pounding in that far. Is that correct?	CC
31354	412979	Yes. That's about it. It wasn't a rapid change in resistive force. And also I noticed when I took the bit off that the material was quite well packed, a good bit darker, and it - The way it adhered to the core tube gave me the distinct impression of being moist. Over.	LMPTRAN
31355	413003	Roger. Understand the general impression of being moist as it packed in the core tube. Next question: we did copy your comments prior to the EVA of your general description of the area. We wonder if either of you would have any more lengthy description or more detailed description of the general summary of the geology of the area. Over.	CC
31356	413041	Yes let's - we'll - We'll postpone our answer to that one until tomorrow. Okay?	LMPTRAN
31357	413048	Yes, indeed. That'll be fine. Just a couple more here, and I think these may not be quite as lengthy as number 7 there. Can you estimate the stroke of the primary and secondary struts? Over.	CC
31358	413071	Well, I could do it like this, Owen. About all the struts are about equally stroked, and the height from the ground to the first step is about 3 feet or maybe 3 and 1/2 feet, huh?	CDRTRAN
31359	413092	Roger. Understand, Neil. Next topic, as - just after landing, you pointed out that there was a hill to the west along the plus Z axis from the LM. Are there any large rocks in that direction that might block the solar ray during the sunset - as sunset approaches in your locality - Are there any large rocks that might tend to obscure the ray? Over.	CC
31360	413132	No. I don't believe so, I think that it's - It's about as level as any other areas that we chose.	LMPTRAN
31361	413146	Roger. I - -	CC
31362	413147	There's nothing large, anyway, that's going to get in the way.	LMPTRAN
31363	413150	Roger. Copy. That's also the way it appeared from the television, I think. And now the final question. You commented, Neil, that on your approach to the landing spot, you had passed over a football field sized crater containing rather large blocks of solid rock perhaps 10 to 15 feet in size. Can you estimate the distance to this football sized crater from your present position? Over.	CC
31364	413185	I thought we'd be close enough so that when we got outside we could see its rim back there but I couldn't. But I don't think that we're more than a half mile beyond it. That is a half mile west of it.	CDRTRAN
31365	413205	Roger. So you estimate your present position less than half a mile approximately west of this large crater. Over.	CC
31366	413216	That's correct.	CDRTRAN
31367	413218	Okay. Well, that takes care of the questions from our geologists for tonight, and unless you have something else, that'll be all for - from us for the evening. Over.	CC
31368	413232	Okay. Thank you.	LMPTRAN
31369	413341	Tranquility Base, Houston. We've now collected all the ranging data that we can use, and you can go back to caution and warning ENABLE. Over.	CC
31370	413354	Roger. Will do.	LMPTRAN
31371	413538	Tranquility Base, Houston. Over.	CC
31372	413547	Go ahead, Houston.	LMPTRAN
31373	413548	Roger. Two more verifications, here. Can you - will you verify that the disk with messages was placed on the surface as planned, and also that the items listed in the flight plan - all of those listed there were jettisoned. Over.	CC
31374	413568	That's - All that's verified.	LMPTRAN
31375	413571	Roger. Thank you, and I hope this will be a final good night.	CC
31376	413577	Okay.	LMPTRAN

31383	435563	Real fine here. Columbia, request P00 and ACCEPT. We'll shove the state vector in for you right away.	CC
31384	435597	Okay. It's coming up now, Columbia. We're going to keep you a little busy here. As soon as we get the state vector in, we'd like you to go ahead and do a P52 option 3 on this night pass, and then when you come on around the other side there, we'll give you some landmark tracking information on prime 130.

31385	435629	Okay.	CMP
31386	435634	And for your information, we're also going to have Tranquility Base do a P52 when you come around the other time; and I have the P22 information if you're ready to copy.	CC
31387	435654	Go ahead.	CMP
31388	435656	Okay. Track landmark 130 prime using P22, and for information, this will properly position your rendezvous radar transponder. T1 is 122 plus 16 plus 05 - whoops, okay. Stand by.	CC
31389	435724	Columbia, Houston. The computer is yours.	CC
31390	435732	Okay. And I'd like the grid square of this crater 130 prime. Over.	CMP

31402	436011	Columbia, affirmative. And at the T1 time, put your rendezvous radar transponder switch to OPERATE.	CC
31403	436025	All right.	CMP
31404	436026	And this 130 prime is the same one that you tracked prior to descent. Over.	CC
31405	436043	Okay. You've updated your information as to the LM's position and this is your best estimate of where the LM is, is that correct?	CMP
31406	436057	Columbia, that's negative. This 130 is the little bitty crater there that you tracked - John Young's crater - that you tracked prior to descent. And we want that - -	CC
31407	436070	Fine. Okay. You've given up looking for that.	CMP
31408	436073	Affirmative. We want this for one last fix on your plane.	CC
31409	436080	All right. Fine. Understand. Thank you.	CMP
31410	436085	And when the LM does his P22 on your transponder, well then, that'll be our last shot at the LM's position.	CC
31411	436094	Roger. Understand. Do you care whether my transponder is on before T1?	CMP
31412	436115	Roger. It'll be on WARMUP prior to that time, and you can go to OPERATE anywhere around that time.	CC
31413	436124	Yes. I gather it's on its 24 minute warmup now?	CMP
31414	436127	Roger.	CC

31421	438049	Roger. Loud and clear. And how is the resting standing up there. Did you get a chance to curl up on the engine can?	CC
31422	438062	Roger. Neil has rigged himself a really good hammock with a waste tether, and he's been lying	LMPTRAN
31423	438074	Roger. Copy, Buzz. Got a couple of changes to your surface checklist here, and in general, what we're going to want you to do is P22, tracking the command module for one last hack on your position there. And this will be - in other words, P57, P22, and then to press on with the checklist, and the rest of them are a couple of minor changes in the checklist. The main one being that we do not want the rendezvous radar on during the ascent, and we think that this will take care of some of the overflow of program alarms which we're getting during descent.	CC
31424	438125	Okay. We had the rendezvous radar in SLEW during descent, though.	CDRTRAN
31425	438134	Tranquility Base, Houston. I missed that. Say again.	CC
31426	438141	Roger. I say again. We had the rendezvous radar switch in the SLEW position, not the LGC position.	CDRTRAN
31427	438153	Roger. We copy that. But there's a greater duty cycle on - There's a good 15 percent duty cycle on the ascent program there, so just go ahead and leave it off. And I have the changes there if you want to get out your surface checklist, and I can go ahead and start giving them to you.	CC
31428	438179	All right. Go ahead. I've got it out.	CDRTRAN
31429	438181	Okay. Before we start here, request P00 and DATA, and we'll give you some vectors.	CC
31430	438203	Now you've got P00 and DATA.	CDRTRAN
31431	438205	Okay. And on Surface 50 will be the first change there.	CC
31432	438215	Okay. And I understand you want us to do a P57 option 3 and then a P22, is that the general idea? Over.	CDRTRAN
31433	438224	That's affirmative. So on Surface 50 there, down at the bottom of the page, just after PRO after two recycles, stick in a time of 122 plus 15; do P22 as per PGNS 20 of G&N dictionary. Over.	CC
31434	438261	Roger. Understand that's 122 15, do P22 as per PGNS 20, G&N dictionary.	CDRTRAN
31435	438269	Roger. Okay. Let's skip on over to Surface 59.	CC
31436	438290	Okay.	CDRTRAN
31437	438291	Okay. This is going to be for one last vent on the DPS tank there, so at the top of the page just after EPS INVERTER 1, CLOSE, add - Okay, after EPS INVERTER 1, CLOSE, add PROP DESCENT HELIUM REG/VENT CLOSE, and then after STABILIZATION/CONTROL AELD, CLOSE, add PROP DISPLAYS/ENGINE 0VERRIDE/LOGIC, CLOSE. Over.	CC
31438	438362	Roger. Copy. These are two circuit breakers, right?	CDRTRAN
31439	438380	Tranquility Base, affirmative. Those are just the circuit breakers at that time.	CC
31440	438413	Tranquility Base, Houston. Did you get those two on the propulsion circuit breakers?	CC
31441	438422	Roger. I have those two.	CDRTRAN
31442	438424	Okay. Let's go over to Surface 60, and then down the middle of the page, after launch guidance system recommendation from MSFN, then I add the switches there.	CC
31443	438457	Roger. Go ahead then.	CDRTRAN
31444	438458	Okay. After launch guidance system recommendation from MSFN, add DESCENT PROPULSION FUEL VENT, OPEN; add DESCENT PROPULSION OXIDIZER VENT, OPEN; add verify talkback gray. Over.	CC
31445	438502	Roger. DESCENT PROPELLANT FUEL VENT, OPEN; DESCENT PROPELLANT OXIDIZER VENT, OPEN; verify talkback gray.	CDRTRAN
31446	438509	Roger. You got that one, so that'll be the last vent and it will continue venting. Skip over to Surface 61 down there at TIG minus 17.	CC
31447	438550	Roger. I'm there. Go ahead.	CDRTRAN
31448	438552	Okay, at TIG minus 17, delete CB (11). AC Bus A, RENDEZVOUS RADAR, CLOSE, wait 30 seconds; delete PGNS: RENDEZVOUS RADAR, CLOSE; and then add UP DATA LINK switch to VOICE BACKUP. Over	CC
31449	438587	Roger. I have that. We'll leave those two circuit breakers open, and have the UP DATA LINK to VOICE BACKUP; and we'll make the appropriate changes on the following circuit breaker status card.	CDRTRAN
31450	438601	Roger. And then you might add a little note down there at the bottom of the page - Note: - This is at the bottom of page 61 - Note: Do not use tape meter in PGNS, i.e., do not place MODE SELECT switch to PGNS. Over.	CC
31451	438635	Okay. We'll put it in AGS.	CDRTRAN
31452	438640	Roger. Fair enough. That's some more of that computer load business.	CC
31453	438649	Okay. That's all the changes we have for the checklist here. I've got some - just some general notes, I'll read to you on P22, and just for some information. Over.	CC
31454	438668	Okay. Then it looks to me like we ought to get hopping on this P57.	CDRTRAN
31455	438681	Roger. We agree wholeheartedly. And while you're starting on that, I'll read - just read these notes on P22. Call P22 possible program alarm 5.6, range greater than 400 nautical miles, and then use the P22 as described on PGNS 20. Take option 1 in NOUN 06, and use the no update mode. The rendezvous radar will lock on at about 25 degrees elevation above the horizon. If 503 alarm occurs, designate fail. Key a PROCEED and allow the rendezvous radar to search for the CSM. And place the range altitude monitor switch in altitude/altitude rate to prevent the tape meter from driving into the stops. And press on.	CC
31456	438749	Roger. I think I have that.	CDRTRAN

31497	440538	Okay. What do you people think about calling up a VERB 83?	CDRTRAN
31498	440561	Tranquility, Houston. Stand by on that now. We're getting the data now. We're checking on the VERB 83.	CC

31616	443295	We had a lot of help down there, Jim.	CDRTRAN
31617	443432	And, Houston, Tranquility Base is going to give you a few comments with regard to the geology question of last night. We are landed in a relatively smooth crater field of elongate secondary - circular secondary craters, most of which have rims irrespective of their - raised rims irrespective of their size. That's'not universally true. There are - There are a few of the smaller craters around which do not have a discernable rim. The ground mass throughout the area is a very fine sand to a silt. I'd say the thing that would be most like it on Earth is powdered graphite. Immersed in this ground mass are a wide variety of rock shapes, sizes, textures, rounded and angular, many with varying consistencies. As I said, I've seen plain - what looked to be plain basalt and vesicular basalt. Others with no crystals, some with small white phenocrysts, maybe one to less than 5 percent. And the bould - we are in a boulder field where the boulders range generally up to 2 feet with a few larger than that. Now, some of the boulders are lying on top of the surface, some are partially exposed, and some are just barely exposed. And in our traverse around on the surface and particularly working with the scoop, we've run into boulders below the surface - it was probably buried under several inches of the ground mass.	CDRTRAN
31618	443575	Tranquility, Houston. Roger. Very fine description.	CC
31619	443585	I suspect this boulder field may have some of its origin with this large sharp edged rocky rim crater that we passed over at final descent. Now yesterday I said that was about the size of a football field, and I have to admit it was a little - little hard to measure coming in. But I thought that it might just fit in the Astrodome as we came by it. And the rocks in the vicinity of the - of this rocky rim crater are much larger than these in this area. Some are 10 feet or so and perhaps bigger, and they are very thickly populated out to about one crater diameter beyond the crater rim. Beyond that, there is some diminishing, and even out in this area the blocks seem to run out in rows with irregular patterns, and then there are paths between them where there are considerably less surface evidence of hard rocks. Over.	CDRTRAN
31620	443656	Tranquility Base, Houston. We copy. Thank you very much.	CC
31621	443672	And, Tranquility Base, we're through with the ranging. You can take your S band function switch to OFF RESET.	CC
31622	443682	Roger.	CDRTRAN
31623	443685	And, Tranquility, I have a LM consumables update for you.	CC
31624	443693	Roger. Ready to copy.	CDRTRAN
31625	443695	Okay. At 123 plus 00, RCS Alfa 78 - 78 percent PQMD, Bravo is 76 percent PQMD, descent O2 is 62 percent - 62 percent. Descent ampere hours are 590, 590 remaining, ascent ampere hours are 574, 574 remaining. Over.	CC
31626	443741	Roger. Copy. Sounds very good. Thank you.	CDRTRAN
31627	443744	Roger.	CC
31628	443915	Tranquility Base, Houston.	CC
31629	443921	Go ahead, Houston.	CDRTRAN
31630	443923	Roger. For your P57 ..., we did a little looking around, and it looks like Sirius and Rigel out at detent 6 would be real good on that. The Sun angle on Sirius is about 43 degrees, and on Rigel, it's about 55 degrees. Over.	CC
31631	443948	Roger, Houston. The only trouble is that the Sun is in number 5, the closed one. And it appears to also be close enough to detent 6 to shine on the far side of the cone. And it completely obscures detent 6. I'm - unable to use that at all.	LMPTRAN
31632	443977	Okay. We understand it now, and thank you.	CC
31633	444043	Tranquility, Houston. For your information, the circuitry looks real fine on that ascent engine arm circuit breaker.	CC
31634	444054	Roger. I don't think I could get it out now if I wanted to.	LMPTRAN
31635	444060	Roger. We copy.	CC
31636	444065	And it looks like in detent 6 I can pick up Venus right at the fringe, but I can't get anything else.	LMPTRAN
31637	444075	Roger.	CC
31638	444093	And by the way, Houston, our EVA antenna did retract.	CDRTRAN
31639	444097	Roger. Mighty fine. Thank you.	CC
31640	444165	Tranquility, Houston.	CC
31641	444172	Roger. Go ahead.	LMPTRAN
31642	444174	Roger. It looks like you're going to have to reposition the radar here. We suggest you may want to start your TIG minus 45 minute - that point in the checklist at about TIG minus 50. Over.	CC
31643	444190	Roger. Why do you think I need to move the radar?	LMPTRAN
31644	444194	Well, we thought that you probably wouldn't be able to get the star there.	CC
31645	444216	On the rear detent, the radar can be pointing plus X, and I'm - I'll be using right rear. That's okay.	LMPTRAN
31646	444224	Roger. That's fine then.	CC
31647	444343	Tranquility Base, Houston. I have one more late checklist change there on the rendezvous radar position for lift off. Over. From page Surface 57.	CC
31648	444360	Roger. Go ahead.	LMPTRAN
31649	444361	Okay. On Surface 57 there on your VERB 21 NOUN 73 trunnion, leave it 180; the shaft we'd like 335. Over.	CC
31650	444385	Roger. Understand. Shaft 335.	LMPTRAN
31651	444389	Roger. And if the steerable doesn't quite hack it on lift off, looks like the forward OMNI is good for about 30 to 60 seconds after lift off. And then the aft OMNI antenna is good for the rest of the ascent. Over.	CC
31652	444412	Roger. Copy.	LMPTRAN
31653	444430	Houston, we've got two angles here at 3 minutes in ascent. Would you confirm those? Pitch 134 and yaw minus 32. Over.	LMPTRAN
31654	444445	Tranquility Base. Roger. We verify; those are correct.	CC
31655	444641	Tranquility Base, Houston.	CC
31656	444646	Go ahead.	CDRTRAN
31657	444648	Roger. Eagle's looking real fine to us down here. We have a fairly high confidence that we know the position of the LM. However, it is possible that we may have a planes change, but the - In the worst case, it would be up to 30 feet per second. And, of course, we don't expect that at all.	CC
31658	444675	Okay.	CDRTRAN
31659	444684	Houston, Tranquility Base. Since we've still got plenty of time I think I'll go ahead and recycle on this 604.	LMPTRAN
31660	444698	Tranquility. Roger. That's okay with us, and we assume that the primary canister is still aboard. Is this correct?	CC
31661	444712	We have one primary canister on board and one secondary. The other primary is - out in front of the Z - plus - Z pad. Over.	LMPTRAN
31662	444726	Roger. We copy. Thank you.	CC
31663	444821	Ready for the blue bag - -	CDRTRAN

31667	445461	Tranquility Base. It's beautiful.	CC
31668	445468	Okay. We'll proceed.	LMPTRAN
31669	445471	Roger.	CC
31670	445475	I know where the star is; I'm not sure the PGNS knows where gravity is.	LMPTRAN
31671	445479	Okay.	CC
31672	445684	Houston, these are your angles, not ours.	LMPTRAN

31933	453507	Hey, Eagle. Houston loud and clear. Columbia was very weak. We were unable to read him.	CC
31934	453516	Roger. We saw you come up over the horizon and it looks like you had a laser operating. Could you confirm that?	LMPEAGLE
31935	453526	Eagle, Houston. Stand by. We'll check it. And, Eagle, Houston. Can you give us a burn report?	CC
31936	453541	Roger. Stand by.	LMPEAGLE
31937	453564	Okay. The CSI burn was on scheduled time of 125 19 3470, 51.5 feet per second was our solution. After chasing residuals a little bit, we ended up with a minus 0.2, plus 0.7, and minus 0.1. And in the AGS, at that time, we had plus 0.4, plus 0.9, and plus 0.3.	LMPEAGLE
31938	453597	Eagle - Eagle, Houston. We copy. Any plane change? Over.	CC

31943	453646	Roger, Houston, do you have some high gain angles for Columbia? Over.	LMPEAGLE
31944	453654	Roger, Eagle. And, Columbia, stand by. We'll have them for you shortly.	CC
31945	453675	Eagle, Houston. Could you verify you switched lithium hydroxide canisters? Over.	CC
31946	453684	That's affirmative. We started getting an erratic indication on primary, so we switched to secondary, and it was again erratic and I thought it might have been a sensor. But it's settled down now, and we're on the secondary. Over.	LMPEAGLE
31947	453698	Roger. We copy. Mighty fine.	CC

31974	454328	Columbia, Houston. Go.	CC
31975	454342	Eagle, Houston. We're sure that's a sensor problem. You can leave it on PRIMARY.	CC
31976	454350	Okay.	CDREAGLE
31977	454361	Roger. We pulled the circuit breakers.	CDREAGLE
31978	454365	Roger, Eagle.	CC
31979	454381	And our water separator apparently isn't working too well. We're getting a lot of water through the suit loop, and we've changed water separators, but it doesn't seem to have improved the situation any.	CDREAGLE

32010	455075	Okay. It's not going to be too much trouble.	CDREAGLE

32099	461010	Okay.	LMP
32100	461023	I'm pumping up cabin pressure.	CMP
32101	461069	That was a funny one. You know, I didn't feel it shock, and I thought things were pretty steady. I went to RETRACT there, and that's when all hell broke loose. Were you guys - did it appear to you to be - that you were jerking around quite a bit during the retrack cycle?	CMP
32102	461090	Yes. It seemed to happen at the time I put the plus X thrust to it, and apparently it wasn't centered, because somehow or other I accidentally got off in attitude and then the attitude hold system started firing.	CDR
32103	461109	Yes. I was sure busy there for a couple of seconds.	CMP
32104	461119	Are you hearing me all right? I got a horrible squeal.	CMP

32108	461144	Roger. I'm supposed to adjust the oxygen flow in this thing to six tenths of a pound per hour, but being as how this transducer is not working right, could you give me an updated number?	CMP
32109	461155	Affirmative. You want to go ahead and adjust your O2 flow until it just goes off the peg, and then crank the direct O2 valve back down about 5 degrees. Over.	CC
32110	461174	Boy, you were really waiting for that one, weren't you? Okay, Ron. Thank you.	CMP
32111	461219	Houston, I did that, and I believe we are flowing oxygen, but the gage is just pegged FULL SCALE LOW.	CMP
32112	461228	Roger. That's fine. That's what we expect.	CC
32113	461233	Okay.	CMP
32114	461244	Okay. I'm going to go ahead with the tunnel leak check.	CMP
32115	461252	Columbia, Houston. I have a new LM weight for you whenever you're ready to copy.	CC

32117	461270	Roger. We'll stand by.	CC
32118	461336	Houston, Apollo 11. I let P47 run longer than I should. I may have deteriorated our state vector slightly.	CMP

32137	462616	Go ahead, Houston, Eagle here.	LMP
32138	462617	Roger. Any time prior to jettison there, we'd like an AGS to PGNS align: 400 plus 30 000. Over.	CC
32139	462634	Okay. Any particular attitude you would like the PGNS in when we do that?	LMP
32140	462647	No. We're not getting any. Could you give us some course align gimbal angles to move the PGNS to, and then we will align the AGS to the PGNS. Over.	LMP
32141	462658	Roger. Eagle. We concur. Stand by on the gimbal angles. And also, Eagle, while we've got the command module direct O2 on there, there's a possibility that your cabin relief might relieve if we get up around cabin pressure of about 5.4 or 5.5.	CC
32142	462684	Roger.	LMP
32143	462725	Eagle, Houston.	CC
32144	462730	Roger. Go ahead.	LMP
32145	462731	Roger. All we are trying to do is get PGNS and AGS aligned together. Doesn't make any difference on the gimbal angle.	CC
32146	462748	...	CDR
32147	462754	Okay. We are pretty close to 000. Is that all right?	LMP
32148	462758	Eagle, that's beautiful.	CC
32149	462764	Now, you might want to take into account what will happen when the CSM maneuvers to jettison attitude.	LMP
32150	462776	Eagle, Houston. We don't care what - All we are trying to do is get a drift rate and see how long it takes them to drift apart on the thing after you jettison.	CC
32151	462788	Okay. Will we be jettisoning at about this attitude? That's okay. I'll align the AGS with the PGNS. You can tell me a little later if you need some help.	LMP
32152	462802	Eagle, Houston. That's fine.	CC
32153	462991	Houston, Columbia. You want me to roll over and get high gain or anything like that?	CMP
32154	462998	Columbia, Houston. I can give you some REACQ angles for the high gain on the LM jettison attitude. Then you can go there whenever you want to. The angles are pitch minus 50, and yaw zero.	CC
32155	463022	Okay.	CMP
32156	463087	Houston, Columbia. Say again the jettison roll, pitch, and yaw, please.	CMP

32167	463325	Roger. Just a reminder to be sure to zero the AGS errors before you enable the AGS attitude hold there after you get in burn attitude.	CC
32168	463346	Roger. You mean SEP attitude?	LMP
32169	463367	Houston, how do you read Columbia on high gain now?	CMP
32170	463370	Hey, Columbia. Houston. Mighty fine; loud and clear.	CC
32171	463376	Same here, Ron. Thanks.	CMP

32178	463513	Columbia. Go ahead.	CMP
32179	463515	Roger, Mike. You want to tweak the O2 flow up just a bit there?	CC
32180	463522	Okay. Coming up. Houston, do you have any preferences as to what you want us to do with the probe? Over.	CMP
32181	463536	Columbia, Houston. Stand by one.	CC
32182	463543	Okay. Eagle says they've got a place for it inside there, so no problem.	CMP
32183	463548	Roger. That's all we were assuming.	CC
32184	463610	Eagle, Houston.	CC
32185	463626	Eagle. Go ahead.	CDR

32193	463787	Okay.	CDR
32194	463820	You say you wanted the probe now?	CMP
32195	464026	Eagle, Houston.	CC
32196	464033	Houston, Eagle. Go ahead.	CDR
32197	464034	Roger. That ACA out of detent didn't quite do it because the mode control switches were off. Request guidance control to PGNS and then back to AGS, and that will zero the AGS, there. Over.	CC
32198	464052	Say again, please.	CDR
32199	464054	Roger. Request guidance control switch to PGNS and then back to AGS. Over.	CC
32200	464063	Okay. We still have both mode control switches off. Over.	CDR
32201	464068	That's okay. That's good.	CC
32202	464079	And I thought I'd just take about 5 seconds here and see if I could get 000 gone, since we're fairly close to gimbal lock right now.	CDR
32203	464096	Eagle, Houston. That's fine.	CC
32204	464283	Columbia and Eagle, Houston. About 5 minutes to LOS. Your LM jet time will be 131 plus 52, and I have the rest of the maneuver PAD if you want it now, or I can give it to you on the next time around.	CC
32205	464305	Stand by one.	CMP
32206	464323	Could you read it around the next time around, please?	CMP
32207	464327	Sure, Mike. That's fine. We'll get it to you then.	CC
32208	464512	Apollo 11, Houston. About a minute and a half to LOS. You're looking great. It's been a mighty fine day.	CC
32209	464522	Boy, you're not kidding.	CMP
32210	467455	Hello, Eagle. Houston. Do you read? Over.	CC
32211	467462	Houston, this is Columbia. Reading you loud and clear. We're all three back inside; the hatch is installed. We're running a pressure check leak check. Everything's going well.	CDR
32212	467471	Roger, Eagle. Correction - Roger, Columbia. We copy. You guys are speedy; you beat us to the punch. We had a couple of things for you.	CC
32213	467485	What are they?	CDR
32214	467486	Oh, it was just - We wanted you to close the CO2 sensor breaker and give us an RCS onboard readout out of Eagle, but that's all. Columbia, Houston. We've got a state vector for you if you'll give us P00 in ACCEPT. Over.	CC
32215	467514	Buzz says the CO2 sensor circuit breaker is IN	CDR
32216	467518	Roger. Thank you very much.	CC
32217	467529	The RCS quantity was approximately 60 at A and 45 percent at B.	CDR
32218	467534	Roger.	CC
32219	467539	And we're going P00 in ACCEPT.	CDR
32220	467541	Roger. Thank you.	CC
32221	467647	Columbia, Houston. Your friendly White Team's going to be on till we get you on the way home, and we'd like to congratulate everybody on a successful rendezvous and a beautiful EVA. It was a great show for everybody. Over.	CC
32222	467665	Thank you, sir. I'll tell Neil and Buzz.	CMP
32223	467679	Houston, the hatch passes its integrity check. I'm going to go to LM tunnel VENT now, and leave it there.	CDR
32224	467691	Roger, Colualbia. We copy. That's good, and we'd like a readout on the TEP of about the time you - that Eagle selected the secondary loop. Over.	CC
32225	467705	Stand by.	CDR
32226	467717	Hello, Columbia. Houston. We got the load in. You can do the VERB 66 and the computer is yours. Over.	CC
32227	467724	Roger.	CDR
32228	467761	Houston, Apollo 11. I'd say that the secondary loop was actuated about 15 to 20 minutes ago. Over.	LMP
32229	467771	Roger. Copy. Columbia. Thank you very much.	CC
32230	467840	Columbia, Houston. It looks like you guys are so speedy on us that we're thinking about moving up jettison time to about a GET of 130 plus 30, if that's okay with you all. Over.	CC
32231	467861	That's fine. I've still got to get a P30 PAD from you.	CMP
32232	467869	Roger. We want to talk to you about that. Mike, we can - for your druthers, we can do it either way. We can either let you do it in the jettison in P30 - correction P47, or we can send you a P30 target load up and then you - let you call P41, whichever you want to do. Over.	CC
32233	467893	Yes, I see. Ron was going to give me a P30 PAD and the flight plan says P47. Out of the two, I prefer to go to P30, P41 route.	CMP
32234	467900	Roger. Beautiful. We've got the load. If you'll give us P00 and ACCEPT, we'll send you a load up. Stand by.	CC
32235	467921	Columbia, Houston. We'd like you to terminate direct O2 flow, and stand by on your P00 and ACCEPT. We'll have to generate a new load due to the moveup on time. Over.	CC
32236	467936	Roger.	CMP
32237	468133	Columbia, Houston. Over.	CC
32238	468139	Go ahead.	CMP
32239	468141	Roger, Mike. It looks like if we move up this jettison time and give you a new load, it would require a new attitude, and we can't do that due to the LM already closed out, and it would fight us all the way around and we'd lose COMM with it. We're thinking separating in P47 in about 10 minutes. We're looking at trajectories and we'll be right with you momentarily. Over.	CC
32240	468166	Okay. It's no big thing with me either way.	CMP
32241	468168	Roger.	CC
32242	468274	Hello, Columbia. Houston. We'd like you to start down your jettison checklist. We recommend	CC
32243	468623	Columbia, Houston. Don't try to chase it, just hold what you've got.	CC
32244	468632	Charlie, did it hold cabin pressure this time?	LMP
32245	468635	Say again, Buzz. Over.	CC
32246	468636	Okay. I thrusted back - I thrusted back toward it a little bit, Charlie, and I'm now reading NOUN 83, plus four balls 4, minus four balls 8, and you want me to kill average D. Right?	LMP
32247	468653	Stand by. That's affirmative. You can exit P47.	CC
32248	468665	There she goes. It was a good one.	CDR
32249	468668	Roger dodger. We got Eagle looking good. It's holding cabin pressure and it picked up about 2 feet per second from that jettison.	CC
32250	468679	I believe that. I can see some cracks on the outer coating around the tunnel. In the thermal protective covering, I don't think it has anything to do with the structure.	LMP
32251	468695	Roger.	CC
32252	468763	Hello, Columbia, Houston. We'll have an attitude and a little blip burn for you in about 130 30, so we can separate from Eagle. Over.	CC
32253	468776	That's fine.	CMP
32254	469009	Columbia, Houston. Would you start a maneuver to a pitch of 230 for this little tweak burn? Over.	CC
32255	469021	Roger. Pitch 230.	CMP
32256	469023	Roger, Mike. And verify track mode in AUTO for the high gain.	CC
32257	469035	We're in REACQ. Is that all right?	CMP
32258	469037	Say again. We need AUTO.	CC
32259	469043	Say again. We're in REACQ - AUTO REACQ.	CMP
32260	469046	Roger. We need AUTO, please, sir.	CC
32261	469051	Okay. You got it.	CMP
32262	469062	Roll zero, pitch 320, yaw zero?	CMP
32263	469067	Right now that's what we're looking at. Stand by. We might have you roll so we can keep the high gain. Stand by.	CC
32264	469076	Roger.	CMP
32265	469145	Columbia, Houston. Over.	CC
32266	469149	Go ahead.	CMP
32267	469150	Roger, Mike - -	CC
32268	469151	Apollo 11, these days.	CDR
32269	469152	Oh, Roger, Apollo 11. We got you going to a posigrade attitude and we want you - this burn will be using minus X thrusters at about 2 or 3 feet per second, and we got a load for you. We'll send it up momentarily. Over.	CC
32270	469173	Okay.	CMP
32271	469256	Apollo 11, Houston. Would you give us P00 and ACCEPT? We have a load for you. Over.	CC
32272	469262	You got it.	CMP
32273	469264	Roger, Mike. And our pitch attitude's a little wrong here. If you're ready to copy, I'll give you the SEP PAD. Over.	CC
32274	469273	Go ahead. Ready to copy.	CMP
32275	469274	Roger. Starting with NOUN 33: 130 30 0000, plus 00020, plus all zeros, plus all zeros. Roll all zeros, pitch 230, yaw zero. NOUN 44 is NA. DELTA-VP 00020, burn time 007, DELTA-VC 00020. We have - The rest of the PAD is NA.	CC
32276	469335	Roger. GET 130 hours 30 minutes, DELTA-VX 2.0, roll zero, pitch 230, yaw zero, DELTA-VC, 2.0.	CMP
32277	469352	That's affirmative, Apollo 11. And, Mike, it's similar to the SEP burn prior to flight after the undocking here. And the P41 you should see on register 1 - 2, and then you burn minus X until you read 4. Over.	CC
32278	469451	Apollo 11, Houston. Computer's yours. Over.	CC
32279	469459	Roger, Charlie. We switched our OMNI D - Delta, and I lost that last transmission. Would you say again, please? The thing I'm wondering about specifically is that earlier you said it would be minus X thrusters and the PAD indicates plus X. Do you want me to null that to zero or do you want to add 2 and leave it as a 4?	CMP
32280	469479	Roger, Apollo 11. The way we gave it to you in the attitude we're in, it'll be just like the SEP burn that you had yesterday. You'll see - NOUN 85 will give you a plus 2 and then you just burn minus X until you read 4. Over.	CC
32281	469498	Understand.	CMP
32282	469550	Apollo 11, Houston. We see you in P41 now. It might take you a couple of minutes to integrate these vectors that we gave you and if you don't make TIG, it's pretty insensitive. You can just let P41 bring you up to TIG, and when you get to zero, you can burn on that. Over.	CC

32291	470087	Okay. Mike, you can maneuver to your preliminary TEI attitude as shown on page 398 of the flight plan, and the high gain angles are good as shown in the flight plan, and we'd like you to dump the waste water at 131 05 down to 10 percent. Over.	CC
32292	470113	Okay. Understand. I'm going to go to roll 1.1, pitch zero - or 52.6, and yaw 13.8, and you want a waste water dump 10 percent starting at 131 05.	CMP
32293	470128	That's affirmative. Right out the LOS.	CC

32300	470825	That's affirmative, Mike. We're looking at about nominal time. We've considered kicking it up a REV, but we don't think this REV track is going to be any good since we had the RCS burn and we need some more tracking to get you a good TEI. Over.	CC
32301	470846	That's what we're looking for.	CMP
32302	470847	Roger.	CC
32303	470859	11, Houston. Looks like it's going to be pretty relaxed time here for the next couple of hours. We'll have you a PAD, of course, the next REV or so, and we'll keep you posted on TEI. Looks like nominal time. Over.	CC
32304	470872	Thank you, Charlie.	CMP

32332	476160	Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. If you guys want it, we've got some news, here, we can read up. Over.	CC
32333	476169	Be pleased to have it.	CDR
32334	476171	Roger, Neil. Starting off: Congratulatory messages on the Apollo 11 mission have been pouring into the White House from world leaders in a steady stream all day. Among the latest are telegrams from Prime Minister Harold Wilson of Great Britain and the King of Belgium. The world's press has been dominated by news of Apollo 11. Some newsmen estimate that more than 60 percent of the news used in papers across the country today concerned your mission. The New York Times which, as we mentioned before, has had such a demand for its edition of the paper today (even though it ran 950 000 copies) said it will reprint the whole thing on Thursday as a souvenir edition. And Premier Alexei Kosygin has sent congratulations to you and President Nixon through former Vice President Humphrey who is visiting Russia. The cosmonauts have also issued a statement of congratulations. Humphrey quoted Kosygin as saying "I want you to tell the President and the American people that the Soviet Union desires to work with the United States in the cause of peace."	CC
32335	476241	And Mrs. Robert Goddard said today that her husband would have been so happy. "He wouldn't have shouted or anything. He would just have glowed." She added, "That was his dream, sending a rocket to the Moon." People around the world had many reasons to be happy about the Apollo 11 mission. The Italian police reported that Sunday night was the most crime free night of the year. And in London, a boy who had the faith to bet $5 with a bookie that a man would reach the Moon before 1970 collected $24.000. That's pretty good odds.	CC
32336	476280	You're probably interested in the comments your wives have made. Neil, Jan had said about yesterday's activities, "The evening was unbelievably perfect. It is an honor and a privilege to share with my husband, the crew, the Manned Spacecraft Center, the American public, and all mankind; the magnificent experience of the beginning of lunar exploration." She was then asked if she considered the Moon landing the greatest moment in her life. She said "No, that was the day we were married." And Mike, Pat said simply, "It was fantastically marvelous." Buzz, Joan said - apparently couldn't quite believe the EVA on the Moon. She said, "It was hard to think it was real until the men actually moved. After the Moon touchdown, I wept because I was so happy." But she added, "The best part of the mission will be the splashdown."	CC
32337	476332	In other news, and there was a little bit, another explorer: Thor Heyerdahl had to give up his attempt to sail a papyrus boat across the Atlantic. The storm damaged boat was abandoned about 650 miles from Bermuda. The speed of the craft had been reduced to about 25 miles a day, and Heyerdahl said the object of the voyage had not been to provide an endurance test for the crew.	CC
32338	476361	Looking at the world of sports, let's see here. While you were busy the other day, Joe Namath and football Commissioner Pete Rozelle made the announcement that "Broadway Joe" had agreed to sell his interest in the Bachelors III restaurant and report to the New York Jets. Joe arrived at the Jets' training camp today and had his first workout. Several other Jet players who had held out along with Joe also reported. And Davy Hill, from Jackson, Michigan, won his third major golf in as many starts in the past week. He won the Philadelphia Classic. Hill has won four tournaments so far this year and is the leading money winner this year with a cool $129.000. And in baseball, the west division of the National League remains a tight race. LA and San Francisco are one game behind league leading Atlanta. The Astros have a record of 48 wins and 48 losses, and are now in fifth place, seven games out. A twin bill between the Astros and Cincinnati last night was postponed because of rain. The Chicago Cubs	CC

I think it's about time you powered down and got a little rest, however. You've had a mighty long day here. Hope you're all going to get a good sleep on the way back. I look forward to seeing you when you get back here. Don't fraternize with any of those bugs in route except for the Hornet.	CC

Only four nations, Communist China, North Korea, North Viet Nam, and Albania, have not yet informed their citizens of your flight and landing on the Moon. One newsman said that he has run out of ways to describe your success. Tonight, President Nixon is scheduled to watch the All Star baseball game in Washington. After the game, he will depart for the Pacific recovery area. Wednesday evening, he will fly from Johnston Island by helicopter to the Navy communications ship Arlington. Then on Thursday morning, he will reboard the helicopter and fly to the Hornet in time to witness your splashdown. Accompanying the President will be Secretary of State William Rogers and Frank Borman. They will watch the splashdown from the bridge of the recovery ship with Admiral John Sidney McCain, Jr., Commander of the Pacific Forces. Following the President's stay aboard the Hornet, he will depart for his tour of Asia and scheduled visit to Romania.

32611	535429	Roger. With respect to the Dow Jones industrials, since closing on Tuesday afternoon the 15th up to about 1:05 p.m. Houston time this afternoon, why, the effect has been a net drop; that is, minus 6 points on the industrial average. So far today since opening, the Dow Jones industrial average has gone down by 11.05 after rising 1 1/2 shortly after opening. Today's performance on the utilities is a drop of 1.63, and railroads a drop of 1.58. Over.	CC

32651	536824	Roger. On LM jettison, are you satisfied that the CO2 circuit breaker was in? Over.	LMP
32652	536830	Yes. It was in.	CC
32653	536837	Roger. Could you confirm that? I thought there was some question after we got into the command module as to whether that had been left in or not. Over.	LMP
32654	536854	Roger, 11. It was in and confirmed in, and the readings after jettison stayed about 0.1 to 0.2.	CC
32655	537864	Apollo 11, this is Houston. We have not noticed any change in the signal coming through on the LMP's EKG. When he has a little free time, we'd like him to check into it again. Over.	CC
32656	537881	Roger. I looked at all three of the upper chest center ones, and they appear to be fairly tight. I'll push them back in again. Over.	LMP
32657	537893	Roger. On the TM here, we noticed some fluctuations that may have been attributed to your moving the sensors around or pushing on them, but the erratic problem seems to be persisting.	CC
32658	539067	Houston, Apollo 11. Over.	LMP
32659	539080	11, this is Houston. Over.	CC
32660	539085	Roger. I wonder if you've noticed any change in the BIOMED returns you're getting. Over.	LMP
32661	539094	Negative, Buzz. It still looks kind of bad. Apparently, when you move around, it's cutting in and out. Have you checked the little electrical connector where it goes into the signal conditioner? Over.	CC
32662	539107	Yes. They're all about as tight as can be. I tell you what; I'll take them off and put them back on again and see if that makes any difference.	LMP
32663	539117	Okay. If you would, at your convience, we'll be watching it down here.	CC
32664	540619	Apollo 11, this is Houston. We'd like you to try acquisition on the high gain antenna for us at pitch minus 90, yaw 270. Over.	CC

32666	540637	Roger. Out.	CC
32667	540756	11, this is Houston. We're showing about 6.8 percent on waste water on our telemetry now. Over.	CC
32668	540768	Okay. We've got about 9, up here. Over.	CMP
32669	540771	Roger. Out.	CC

32671	541719	Thank you, Bruce. You've got about a minute and 20 seconds.	LMP
32672	541722	Roger. We concur.	CC
32673	541876	Houston, do you copy our residuals?	CMP
32674	541893	Roger. We've got your residual fuel counter reading for us.	CC
32675	541903	DELTA-VC is plus 0.2.	CMP
32676	541906	Roger. Plus 0.2.	CC

32683	543401	Apollo 11, this is Houston. We're going to hand over from Madrid to Goldstone at 151 hours even.	CC

32694	545067	Go ahead, 11.	CC
32695	545072	Roger. It didn't like it that time. When I got down to the entry 27303 ENTER, it took off in roll at a high rate in excess of 1 degree per second. Over. I've stopped it now, and we are going to have to go back and do it over again. I'd like to try to find out the reason it did that.	CDR
32696	545095	Roger. You might as well start setting up for it, and we will be working the problem here.	CC
32697	545102	Okay. Do you have us on high bit rate here now?	CDR
32698	545107	That's affirmative.	CC
32699	545111	Okay, good. I'll maneuver back to PTC initiation attitude while you guys look at the data and see what you think.	CDR
32700	545120	Roger.	CC
32701	545150	Houston, Apollo 11. I think the reason is in having 1620 on the DSKY during the subsequent entries, or at least that's one possibility.	CDR
32702	545166	Roger. We'll check it out.	CC
32703	545613	Apollo 11, this is Houston. While you're waiting for the CSM to settle down and for us to look at the tapes on your latest maneuver, would you feel like answering some more questions with relation to the lunar surface? Over.	CC
32704	545632	Go ahead.	CDR
32705	545637	Go ahead, Houston.	CDR
32706	545639	Roger. For 64 thousand dollars, we're still trying to work out the location of your landing site, Tranquility Base. We think it is located on LAM 2 chart at Juliet 0.5 and 7.8. Do you still have those charts on board? Over.	CC
32707	545664	Yes. Stand by one. They're packed.	CDR
32708	545671	Roger. You may not have to unpack it. The position which I just gave you is slightly west of West Crater. I guess it's about two tenths of a kilometer west of it, and we were wondering if Neil or Buzz had observed any additional landmarks during descent, lunar stay, or ascent which would confirm or disprove this. One thing that we're wondering about is that if you were at this position, you would have seen the Cat's Paw during ascent just up to the north of your track. Over.	CC
32709	545718	We were looking for the Cat's Paw, too, thinking we were probably downrange, beyond the Big V. But I think that it's likely that that might have been West Crater that we went across in landing, but - Stand by.	CDR
32710	545782	We're hoping, Bruce, that our 16 mm film was working at that point in descent, and we'll be able to confirm our touchdown position. We thought that during ascent we might be able to pick up some recognizable objects close to the landing site, and we did see a number of small craters, and crater rows, and things like that, which we may be able to pick out after the fact, but we haven't been able to yet.	CDR
32711	545818	Roger. And the next question from our panel is for Buzz. We recall that he reported seeing a laser upon AOS of the Earth the first time after - the first REV after ascent, and we're wondering what color the beam was and if he could determine at the approximate location with respect to the Earth. Over.	CC
32712	545845	It was mostly white, perhaps a tinge of yellowish color to it; and it seemed to be - as I recall it, the terminator of the Earth was toward the horizon and seemed to be about a quarter to a third of the way down from - down towards the terminator of the Earth - from the opposite horizon. That's a third to a quarter Earth radii. Over.	LMP
32713	545890	Roger. And that puts it in the light side? Over.	CC
32714	545898	Roger. Yes, it was in the light side. The Earth was about - a two thirds lit Earth, with the terminator down toward the horizon. And now coming from the opposite limb of the Earth, the sunlight limb, coming down about one quarter to one third of a radius in from the limb. Generally, pensively located with respect to a line drawn perpendicular to the terminator that goes through the center. Over.	LMP
32715	545938	Roger, Buzz. We copy.	CC
32716	545942	And I got pictures of that. I'm sure that will show up.	LMP
32717	545947	And I saw that, too. It was a very bright spot of light and I confirm Buzz's observation of its position.	CDR
32718	545955	Okay, 11. Very good. Now, with respect to the documented sample container: on television it appeared to us as though the samples for that container were in fact being given - being selected in accordance with some thought or consideration being given to the rocks themselves. And we were wondering if you could give any further details from memory about any of these samples, and the context of the material or the surface from which they were taken. Over.	CC
32719	545996	Yes. You remember I initially started on the cut side of the LM that the TV camera was on, and I took a number of samples of rocks on the surface, and several that were just subsurface - about 20 - 15 to 20 feet north of the LM. And then I recalled that that area had been probably swept pretty well by the exhaust of the descent engine, so I crossed over to the southern side of the LM, and took a number of samples from the area around the elongate double crater that we commented on, and several beyond that, and tried to take as many different types - of rock types as I could see by eye - as I could in the short time we had available. There were a number of other samples that I had seen earlier in our stroll around the LM that I had hoped to get back and pick up and put in the documented sample, but I didn't get those, and I'll be able to comment in detail when we get in the debriefing session.	CDR
32720	546077	Roger. Did you observe any small craters with conspicuously blocky rims? Over.	CC
32721	546088	Well, aside from the one big one that we went over, I guess there were none in our area. I took a stroll back after putting up the EASEP, and while Buzz was starting to unpack the documented samples - took a stroll back to a crater behind us that was maybe 70 or 80 feet in diameter and 15 or 20 feet deep, and took some pictures of it. It had rocks in the bottom of pretty good size, considerably bigger than any that were out on the surface, but there was no - we apparently, at 15 feet or so, had not gotten below the regolith. We were essentially showing no bedrock, at least in the walls of the crater at that depth. Over.	CDR
32722	546148	Roger. We copy,	CC
32723	546170	Okay. Thank you, Neil. That about wraps up the questions we have on hand for now.	CC
32724	546180	Okay.	CDR
32725	546230	My compliments to the chef. The food is outstanding. This cream of chicken soup I give at least three spoons.	CDR
32726	546238	Okay. Cream of chicken, three spoons.	CC
32727	546382	Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.	CC
32728	546387	Go ahead.	CMP
32729	546389	11, we concur that having VERB 16, NOUN 20 up on the DSKY may well have had some effect on your PTC initiation. It looks like this would give - let the computer work with a knowledge of the actual CDU angles. What we'd like you to do is do a CDU zero which is VERB 40, NOUN 20, ENTER, and then start the PTC procedure again at step 2 with loading VERB 6, NOUN 22, desired attitude in the AUTO maneuver, and all that. Over.	CC
32730	546428	Okay. The only thing I don't understand about that is why it took off at the rate it did. What rate should it have taken off at under that theory?	CMP
32731	546437	Stand by a minute, Mike.	CC
32732	546737	11, CMP, this is Houston. Over.	CC
32733	546745	Go ahead, Houston.	CMP
32734	546747	Mike, over here on page 9 7 of your checklist where we're setting up PTC, there's been a note penciled in after, "Wait 20 minutes for rate to damp. Do not monitor VERB 16, NOUN 20." It turns out that the significance of that is that, if you are monitoring 16 NOUN 20, then when you get down here in step 7, the second time you do a VERB 24, you've got to reload the NOUN 01 to make it VERB 24, NOUN 01, ENTER, before you load the three registers. Over.	CC
32735	546789	Roger, that. I was just questioning the rate at which the maneuver would begin if that were not done.	CMP
32736	546797	Roger. We're still working on computing the rate for you.	CC

32750	550068	So what's new?	CMP
32751	550071	Oh, we were wondering what was new with you up there.	CC
32752	550076	It's all very quiet. We're just sitting here letting the thruster firing damp down. When they get good enough, let us know, and we'll start this PTC.	CMP
32753	550086	Roger.	CC
32754	550109	Nice to sit here and watch the Earth getting larger and larger and the Moon smaller and smaller.	CMP
32755	550117	Roger. We'll give you a call when your rates have damped down sufficiently, and we're unable at the present time to predict what rate you should have seen at your last attempt to initiate PTC. We saw about 2 1/2 degrees per second. 0ver.	CC
32756	550137	Yes. I believe that.	CMP

32760	551967	Roger. I was just checking the radios, and how is the thruster activity coming?	CMP

32762	552005	Okay. We're - we're in no rush. This is a very pleasant attitude, as a matter of fact. The Sun is down in the LEB, so it's not shining through the windows and heating the place up. We've got the Earth steady out window 1. We have the Moon steadily out window 3 and, of course, we are locked up on the high gain. So as long as the thermal people are happy, we're happy.	CMP

32764	552807	Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.	CC
32765	552813	Go ahead, Houston.	CMP
32766	552815	Okay, 11. We are about ready to start PTC. I would like to give you some high gain antenna angles, though. We'd like to operate in the REACQ mode, and do you plan on spinning up in the positive or negative direction? 0ver.	CC
32767	552832	We can do it either way. I had planned the positive.	CMP
32768	552833	Okay. For positive, the high gain antenna setting should be pitch plus 30, yaw 270, and in REACQ. Over.	CC
32769	552850	Understand. REACQ, pitch plus 30, yaw 270. Thank you.	CMP
32770	552854	Roger. And if you would, when you're making your DSKY entries to set up for PTC, go a little slower, and we'll try to follow each entry from down here. Over.	CC

32790	556877	Negative. It's not. The last time we broke lock, we went to AUTO, and I left it there. Sorry.	LMP
32791	556882	Roger. We'd like to have you to put it in REACQ, and monitor. In about 2 minutes, we'll be coming up on the high gain. Would you monitor the REACQ? If it doesn't take, acquire manually. Over.	CC
32792	556899	Okay. Say again the angles you'd like.	LMP

32801	557469	I don't guess we have a requirement there, Charlie.	CMP
32802	557474	Roger. We have an attitude that we can get the Earth out of a window or the Moon. We're trying to look at - find one that we can get both, if that's what you'd like. Over.	CC
32803	557493	A 50 degree roll attitude will probably give us that, Joe.	CMP
32804	557497	Roger.	CC
32805	557509	That's a good one because it puts the Earth out window 1 and the Moon out window 3 and puts the Sun down in the LEB, so the lighting in here remains relatively constant.	LMP

32807	557529	Okay.	CMP

32841	560594	11, Houston. We have an excellent picture now. Over.	CC
32842	560599	Okay. How do you read me, Charlie?	LMP
32843	560601	Five by now, Buzz. Over.	CC
32844	560604	Okay. The more mundane affairs, now that we've left the Moon, I'd like to trace through them a little bit for you *** developments that have taken place in the food department. I'm sure you've already *** type of a drink container. A little later, Mike will show you how the water gun operates with its new filter to take out the hydrogen. Essentially, this water gun is put in this end and fills up this bag with water, and the drink then dissolves in the water, and this end of the *** outfeeding. Likewise, we have other foods that are more solid nature. You can	LMP
32845	560677	11, Houston. Buzz, you're breaking up badly. Will you check your VOX? Over.	CC
32846	560687	Roger. How am I coming through now, Charlie?	LMP
32847	560689	Roger. You're very clear when you come through. It's just that your VOX is not keying at every word. Over.	CC
32848	560697	Okay. These bite sized objects were designed to remove the problem of having so many crumbs floating around in the cabin, so they designed a particular size that would be able to go to the mouth all at once. I think since all of our experience, we've discovered that we could progress a good bit further than that back some of the type meals that we have on Earth. As a matter of fact, on this flight we've carried along pieces of bread, and along with the bread we have a ham spread; and I'll show you, I hope, how easy it is to spread some ham while I'm in zero g.	LMP
32849	560777	I think we've discovered that it is quite easy to *** you're all very familiar with.	LMP
32850	560804	Apollo 11, Houston. We notice your roll rate increasing. Will you please see if you can bring that down to about 04 or we'll be losing high gain shortly. Over.	CC
32851	560823	You can also use zero gravity to demonstrate many things that we've all learned in school. I'd like to demonstrate briefly how easy it is to explain the action of the gyroscope. If I spin this can, we know that according to the equations of motion that we would expect that once this is given a spin, and has a spin axis in this direction, if we give it a particular torque, and I'll do this by pushing my hands against it in this fashion once it's spinning. By the equations we can predict that, as I put this torque on it, it will in fact rotate this direction. Let's see how well this works out.	LMP
32852	560873	See that as I apply the torque this way, it's rotated this way.	LMP
32853	560892	Too close, I think.	CMP
32854	560912	11, Houston. It's a pretty good demonstration.	CC
32855	560926	Houston, this next is a little demonstration for the kids at home, all kids everywhere, for that matter. I was going to show you how you drink water out of a spoon, but I'm afraid I filled the spoon too full and if I'm not careful, I'm going to spill water right over the sides. Can you see the water slopping around on the top of the spoon, kids?	CMP
32856	560947	That's affirmative, 11.	CC
32857	560952	Okay. Well, as I said, I was going to show you but I'm afraid I filled it too full and it's going to spill over the sides. I'll tell you what. I'll just turn this one over and get rid of the water and start all over again. Okay?	CMP
32858	560967	Okay.	CC
32859	560975	And you can see, up here we don't know where over is. One up is as good as another. That really is water, though. I'll show you.	CMP
32860	561004	That's really not the way we drink. We really have a water gun which I'll show you.	CMP
32861	561015	Here's the water gun. This cylindrical thing on the end of it is a filter with several membranes: one allows water to pass, but not any gas; the other allows gas to pass, but not any water. So, by routing the gaseous water which comes from our tank through this filter, we're enabled to drink purified water without the gas in it, filtered water. And, of course, all we do to - to get it started is just pull the trigger.	CMP
32862	561058	It's sort of messy. I haven't been at this very long. It's sort of the same system that the Spaniards used to drink out of wineskins at bull fights, only I think this is even more fun. Well, be seeing you, kids.	CMP
32863	561074	Thank you from all us kids in the world, here in the MOCR, who can't tell the Earth from the Moon.	CC
32864	561083	Roger. Stand by one, and we'll get you that Earth one.	CMP
32865	561089	Looks like you need a wine skin up there, Mike.	CC
32866	561095	That'd be nice.	CMP
32867	561170	Okay.	CMP

32870	561176	That's affirmative. I refuse to bite on this one, though. You tell us.	CC

32877	561445	Apollo 11, Houston. We were curious to see if there was any excess moisture up around the tunnel hatch area as we saw on 10. Over.	CC
32878	561459	It just so happens that's what we were talking about now. There is a little bit of dampness around the outside edge of the hatch, but a very, very slight amount. We've got a hose up there that we're hoping will sort of help keep it a little bit dry.	CMP
32879	561478	Roger, Mike. Thank you much. Have you seen any more water collecting on the aft bulkhead? Over.	CC
32880	561487	No, we haven't, as a matter of fact. It's been dry in that area since we got rid of that last time.	CMP

32884	562040	Houston, Apollo 11. Could you get a little summary of the evening news for us?	CMP
32885	562046	Yes, sir. We'll have it for you momentarily. Also, a little flight plan update, Mike. If you - On page 3 113, you can delete the O2 fuel cell purge. Over.	CC
32886	562058	Will do.	CMP
32887	562065	There is a flurry of activity in the PA0 site for the evening news.	CC

32889	562083	How's the weather down there? You got any rain?	CMP
32890	562085	Roger. We've been having a little bit, thunderstorm type, the last couple of days. We had a pretty good rain today, smd it's been overcast. A slow storm system's been moving through the area in the last couple of days, and primarily evening and afternoon thundershowers.	CC
32891	562106	Roger. We were watching a few clouds in your area through the monocular along the Texas Gulf Coast this afternoon, and we also noticed there were clouds over Baja California, which is a little bit unusual.	CMP
32892	562120	Roger. Thank you for the weather report. We can't quite see that far. It seems to have	CC
32893	562138	Yes. We also noticed it was a little overcast down over - in the Antarctic ice cap, too.	LMP

32895	562148	How's that for one-upsmanship?	CMP

32898	562165	It's apparently raining fairly hard up in Washington where the All Star game was to be played tonight. They started out, I understand, and then it was rained out and they called it off.	CC

32903	562205	Stand by Buzz. It looks pretty good as far as I could tell. We got the - along the tropical convergence line there, there's a few clouds shown on the weather map I'm looking at here, but nothing of significance. Right now - Stand by. Let's see, right now in the mid - yes, at the MPL - we've got 3000 scattered, visibility 10, waves height 3 feet, is the present weather.

32913	562624	Go ahead.	CC
32914	562630	What we'll do Charlie, tomorrow, is go through and reconfigure our stowage as closely as possible to nominal. Some things that will not be nominal are as follows: the EVA visors were brought back into the command module, and we have not yet found a home for them. We'll let you know where they go. In addition, there's about 5 pounds of miscellaneous weight from the LM	CDR

32918	562942	Okay. Thank you.	CMP
32919	562944	And Buzz, we're still not getting any data from your EKG. It looks like the only way that we're going to be able to get any is if, at your convenience, you would take your - change out your EKG leads, which are the center ones that are connected to the blue pin; and there's a spare one in the medical box. Over.	CC
32920	562975	Roger. How many did you want me to change?	LMP
32921	562977	Just the center one. I'll get the right nomenclature from the Doc. Stand by. It's called the sternal EKG, which are the three center ones, and it's got - they lead into a - into the blue stringed lead ones. Over.	CC
32922	563004	Okay. There's three of them, is that right?	LMP
32923	563006	That's affirmative.	CC
32924	563010	And you want me to change all three.	LMP
32925	563012	That's affirmative and they're all hooked together from the picture I'm looking at, and they go into the center belt, signal conditioner, and it's got the blue strain relief on it.	CC
32926	563026	Yes. I checked the connectors at both ends on that. I don't guess we have a spare signal conditioner or anything like that, do we?	LMP
32927	563032	No. We do not.	CC
32928	563042	Well, I can show you my heart's still working.	LMP
32929	563046	We believe it.	CC
32930	563063	Charlie, what we suggest here is, before we start that, turn our two suit powers off and plug his blue lead into my blue signal conditioner and see if we can get his signal through my signal conditioner. Okay?	CDR
32931	563078	Roger. That's a good suggestion, Neil. We concur. Over.	CC
32932	563183	Okay, Charlie. We're transmitting, and let's see if you get any EKG signal on the CDRat this point.	LMP
32933	563192	Roger. Stand by.	CC
32934	563202	11, Houston. We get some data, but it's got the same problem that we had through Buzz's signal conditioner, so apparently the lead is broken and we'd like you to change it out if you could. Over.	CC
32935	563216	Okay.	LMP
32936	563218	Thank you.	CC
32937	563892	Houston, Apollo 11.	LMP
32938	563894	Go ahead, sir.	CC
32939	563897	Roger. I think the problem was that the center lead had dried out. ... put the new one on, and I'll see how that works. Over.	LMP
32940	563912	Roger.	CC
32941	563916	I can't tell you how good it feels to get it off.	LMP

32946	564528	Stand by. We'll let the docs look at it. Buzz, we're on low bit rate. We'll get you on a high gain momentarily, and we'll let you know then. Over.	CC
32947	564544	Okay. I got my high gain antenna coming out.	LMP
32948	564551	Roger. Just leave on REACQ. We'll get you.	CC
32949	564758	Apollo 11, Houston. Buzz, your EKG looks good now. The doc said thanks a lot.	CC

32951	565435	Apollo 11, Houston. Based on our sighting since the midcourse, we're showing a gamma of minus 6.57. This is preliminary, though, and we think that after some more tracking it should come on in, and we could tweak it right on into the corridor. It's just about in the center of the corridor; everything's looking fine. We'll have you an entry PAD in a couple of hours before you go to sleep. And from our friends in public affairs, a few headlines, other than your flight. You're still dominating the news. However, there are some other things of interest for you. As I mentioned earlier, the All Star game was rained out. It's going to be played tomorrow. However, President Nixon will not be able to see it as he planned. We'll keep you posted on results. And, also, the weathermen are going to be good to you. Our forecast is, looks like it's holding good for the recovery area; it should be real fine out there. President Nixon, as he prepares to fly out to greet	CC
32952	565550	And back in Washington, the House Ways and Means Committee agreed to tax changes affecting oil companies, banks, and utilities that could add nearly 2 billion a year to federal revenue. And, also today, NASA announced it will launch a large orbital workshop in 1972, with a cutdown version of the Saturn V. And, your television pictures attracted a lot of interest. They were shown live throughout just about the whole world, and, we're expecting hundreds of telephone calls from mothers all over the world complaining that their youngsters are trying to drink milk from spoons, thanks to you, Mike.

33004	570040	Apollo 11, Houston. I was just reading some of the transcripts of earlier today about this earlier PTC that we attempted, and when you keyed into VERB 24 and did the two ENTER's, it took off on you. I think we got a story on that, if you'd like to listen to why it had such a high rate, Mike. Over.	CC
33005	570066	Yes. I'm all ears.	CMP
33006	570068	Okay. I think it would be better if you got your checklist out on 97, and we could walk you through it, and that way I could probably get the story straight. Over.	CC
33007	570081	Okay. I got it.	CMP
33008	570082	Okay. Mike, what happened is - you know, you were sitting there monitoring VERB 16, NOUN 20, and at step 7 you went into VERB 24, NOUN 01, and keyed in the address and then INFORMATION INFORMATION; and on the final ENTER of that 35400 ENTER, right after that, it - that then put you back into the 16, NOUN 20. Then when you did the VERB 24, ENTER, you were really entering the information in the actual CDU; and when you got the two entries in, in register 1 and 2, it was an - it was an instantaneous change in the actual CDU, and the CM DAP looked at that and saw - saw what it thought it	CC
33009	570168	Okay. I got you.	CMP
33010	570170	Roger.	CC
33011	570171	Man.	CMP
33012	570204	Hey, Charlie, are you saying that for a short period of time, he actually loaded NOUN 20 with some value other than was being read by the CDU?	LMP
33013	570214	I think I got that, Buzz. That's affirmative. But when he did that second VERB 24, you were - the NOUN was 20, so when he did the 3175 and then a 002 ENTER, what he actually did there was load the first two actual CDU locations, and the computer looked at it - the DAP looked at it as an instantaneous change in the actual CDU. Stand by on your comments. We're switching antennas.	CC
33014	570243	Roger.	LMP
33015	570245	- - We're very scratchy.	CC
33016	570248	Okay.	LMP
33017	570283	11, Houston. We got you back now on the high gain. Did you copy all that, Buzz? Over.	CC
33018	570291	Yes. I think so. I - I thought maybe that NOUN 20 was one of those that you could never load from the DSKY, and that still maybe. Maybe it was loaded just for the short period of time, and then when the counters read the - the gimbal angles, why they changed it back to what they actually are. But in the meantime, the DAP saw this different number. Is that right?	LMP
33019	570317	Well, our guidance guy was telling me that you can actually load those ACDU's, the actual CDU's, but we'll - we're checking on that. Over.	CC
33020	570330	Okay.	LMP
33021	570342	11, Houston. Buzz, the word from the back room is that you can actually load the NOUN 20, but you should not.	CC

33027	570841	I doubt if it will fit on the helmet in B1. The other one might - might go in the sleep restraint. We've got them in our helmet bags, and I guess we're going to have to keep the helmets in the helmet bags, and the LEVVA's in the LEVVA bags.	CDR
33028	570860	Roger.	CC

And for your information, looking at it right now, based on all the tracking we got, that maneuver would only be a tenth of a foot per second. So, we'll probably skip it. We'll let you know more about that later. Okay. Your horizon check at EI minus 30 minutes, GET of 194 33 03, gives you a pitch angle of 298. Okay.

33063	576279	Roger. Thank you very much. We're not as sleepy tonight as we were last night.	LMP
33064	576286	Yes. I guess you guys were pretty tired last night after that busy day.	CC

33075	615642	Roger, 11. You're breaking up just a little bit there, Neil. Your signals are loud but are breaking up occasionally. Your spacecraft all looks good here from the ground. We noticed you stirring around the cockpit and thought we'd give you a call. Over.	CC
33076	615659	Good morning.	CDR
33077	615667	11, Houston. We do have a few items for you here, entry PAD's, consumables, and so forth. After you've had a chance to get organized, whenever you're ready to start on a few of these items, why, we'll read them up to you. Over.	CC
33078	615682	Okay. Stand by.	LMP
33079	615710	Go ahead, Owen. I've got the book now. I'm ready to copy.	LMP
33080	615712	Okay, Buzz. On your flight plan items, a few updates first of all. We've cancelled midcourse number 6. Just remain - remain in PTC. I'll give you a little more time this morning. Second item on the flight plan is we're ready for a BATT B charge anytime you want to put it on the line; and third item, we'd like a waste water dump a little differently this time. We'd like	CC
33081	615773	Roger. You must have stayed up all night figuring this one out.	LMP
33082	615780	11, Houston. Stand by just a moment here until we get out of the NO position on the antenna.	CC
33083	615854	11, Houston. We're over on OMNI Delta now. I think we can read you better. Did you get all those first three items on your flight plan update? Over.	CC
33084	615865	I got midcourse correction cancelled; battery B charge and water dump on your call. Over.	LMP
33085	615875	That's right, Buzz; and the last item here, we do request that we do a P52, even though we're not doing midcourse correction; and we suggest you get to that after the waste water dump has been complete. We also have a state vector update for you, if you can give us P00 and ACCEPT. Over.	CC
33086	615909	Okay. You have the DSKY now.	LMP
33087	615912	Roger. We'll be sending that up, and I'll give you your consumables update now. It's - for a time of 170 hours, your RCS total is minus 3.5 percent, Alfa is minus 14.5, Bravo plus 7, Charlie minus 4.5, Delta minus 3; hydrogen total is minus 1, and your oxygen total is plus 24. Over.	CC
33088	615950	Roger. Copy those. And onboard readouts, D is 69, C is 73, D is - Let me start over again. Okay. A is 51 and B is 62; C is 63 and D is 59. Over.	CMP
33089	616007	Roger, 11. Copy those, and we've checked them here on the ground, also. One correction to my last transmission. We would like that P52 prior to the waste water dump, which is coming up in about 30 minutes from now. Will that be possible? Over.	CC
33090	616023	Oh, yes. We'll take care of that.	CMP
33091	616027	Roger. And if you're ready for an entry PAD, I'll read that up to you now, also, 11.	CC
33092	616036	Ready to copy.	CMP
33093	616039	Okay. Entry PAD is area MIDPAC: 359 153 001 194 46 03 267, plus 1102, minus 17203 067 36194 655 11875 36275 195 03 03 00 28; DL and VL, all four are not applicable; DO, 4 00 02 10 00 18 03 38 08 21 44 2932 380; boresight star is Scorpio Theta, up 314, right 34, lift vector up.

33096	616288	Roger.	CMP
33097	616731	Okay, Houston. The crew status report is 8 1/2, 7, and 8.	CDR

33099	616748	Right.	CDR
33100	616753	11, Houston. Your P52 looks good here on the ground, and we are now estimating that water dump will occur along about 171 plus 40; and we'd like for you to dump to 45 percent. This should let you arrive at Earth interface with just about a full load of waste water. Over.	CC
33101	616777	Understand 171 40, approximately, 40 percent.	CDR
33102	616934	11, Houston. We'd like to advance the time on that water dump to about 171 plus 30 just after we reacquire on the next 0MNI, and - as I mentioned, it'll be down to 45 percent - is the new quantity. Also, we're standing by for your CM RCS ejector temperature readout. Over.	CC
33103	617138	Apollo 11, Houston. I'm not certain you copied my last transmission, as we were just in the process of switching OMNI's. We'd like to advance the time on that water dump until about 5 minutes from now. And we'll give you a precise mark on the time to start the dump, and we are standing by for a readout on your CM RCS ejector temperatures. Over.	CC
33104	617160	Okay, Owen. We're standing by for your mark, and stand by for the readout.	CMP
33105	617163	Roger.	CC
33106	617200	Houston, Apollo 11. Are you ready to copy ejector temperatures? I'll read them in volts.	CMP
33107	617206	That's affirmative. Go ahead, Mike.	CC
33108	617209	Okay. 2 4 is reading 4.7 volts, 2 5 is reading 4.8 volts, 1 2 is reading 4.8 volts, 1 4 is reading 4.8, 1 6 4.5, and 2 1 4.8. Over.	CMP

33111	617580	Roger. Dumping.	CMP
33112	617610	Apollo 11, Houston. We show you - -	CC
33113	617612	Houston, Apollo 11. We've dumped to 45 percent, and we're stopping now. Do you concur?	CMP
33114	617617	Roger, 11. We concur.	CC
33115	618815	Apollo 11, Houston. I can read up your forecast weather for the recovery any time you'd like to hear about it. Over.	CC
33116	618825	Go ahead.	LMP
33117	618827	11, Houston. Present forecast shows acceptable conditions in your recovery area: 2000 foot scattered, high scattered, wind from 070 degrees, 13 knots, visibility 10 miles, and sea state about 4 feet. The forecast yesterday showed a tropical storm, Claudia, some 500 to 1000 miles east of Hawaii. The - the pictures from Earth satellites taken yesterday afternoon - afternoon showed Claudia dissipating, so this appears to be even less a factor than it was before. Your recovery area is now believed to be just a little ways north of the intertropical convergence zone, which you can probably see when you look out your windows there. Yesterday there was also a report of a tropical storm, Viola, further to the west. Its present location is some thousand miles east of the Phillipines and moving northwest. Tropical storm Viola has been intensifying, and should be transferred to the typhoon category within the next 12 hours or so; however, that will be far to your west. As a matter of fact, sunrise terminator has not yet reached Viola. When it does several hours from now, you can probably distinguish it from your viewpoint quite readily. As a matter of fact it should be of interest to perhaps take some pictures. Comment on it when you get a chance to see Viola in a few hours. So that's about the present weather state and situation for your recovery area. Over.	CC
33118	618940	That sounds pretty good ...	CMP
33119	620236	Apollo 11, Houston. Over.	CC
33120	620242	Go ahead, Houston.	CDR
33121	620244	11, Houston. We'd like to try operation with the high gain array here. If you would select reacquire and your S band antenna to HIGH GAIN, your positions are pitch plus 40 and yaw 270, and then monitor for acquisition. Over.	CC
33122	620268	Okay. It's in work.	CMP
33123	620485	11, Houston. We're just now ready to switch from OMNI Delta over to your high gain antenna. Can you confirm that you have gone to REACQ? Over.	CC
33124	620495	Confirmed.	CMP
33125	620584	That looks real good, Mike. Looks like we picked up about 30 dB on the signal strength.	CC
33126	620591	Yes. It came in quite quickly. However, I'm showing about 240 yaw and about zero on pitch, now.	CMP
33127	620602	Roger. About 240 and 0.	CC
33128	624923	Apollo 11, Houston. Over.	CC
33129	624928	Go ahead.	CDR
33130	624929	Roger. Just wanted to make sure you fellows hadn't gone back to sleep again. And I also have a little bit of late news here if you'd like to find out what's happened in the last 12 - 14 hours. Over.	CC
33131	624942	Okay. Go ahead.	CDR
33132	624944	Okey doke. Hot off the press here: We find Juan Carlos was formally designated yesterday - Tuesday - to become General Franco's successor - as the Chief of State of Spain and eventual King. Juan Carlos will be sworn in today as his successor designate after taking an oath of loyalty to the law and the National Movement, Spain's only legal political organization. He will apparently be called the Prince of Spain.	CC
33133	624974	House Ways and Means Committee also has agreed yesterday to tax changes affecting oil companies, also banks and utilities, which could add as much as 2 billion dollars per year to the federal revenue. The committee also voted tentatively to change the accounting procedures for telephone, electric, gas, and oil pipeline companies and to reduce tax benefits of mutual savings and loan institutions. So, it looks as if tax reform may be on the way.	CC
33134	625002	Looking overseas, we find South Korea's first super highway, linking Seoul with the Port of Inchon, has been named the Apollo Highway to commemorate your trip. I think we mentioned last night that President Nixon has already started on his round the world trip, and today he is in San Francisco on his first stop which will take him to the U.S.S. Hornet, from which he'll watch the return of your spacecraft. He plans to visit seven nations including Rumania during this trip. He, as I think you also knew, had to miss the All Star baseball game yesterday, as it was rained out; but it is being played today.	CC
33135	625048	The West Coast residents in Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon; Vancouver, British Columbia; and San Francisco all plan to make their areas visible to the three of you by lighting their lights between 9 pm and midnight tonight, according to the Associated Press. We do have clear weather predicted there, so you may be able to see Christmas lights, porch lights, store lights, and whatever may be turned on.	CC
33136	625058	Good show.	CDR
33137	625059	A little closer to home here, back in Memphis, Tennessee, a young lady who is presently tipping the scales at 8 pounds, 2 ounces, was named "Module" by her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Eddie Lee McGhee. "It wasn't my idea." said Mrs. McGhee, "It was my husband's." She said she had balked at the name Lunar Module McGhee, because it didn't sound too good, but apparently they have compromised on just Module. Over.	CC
33138	625109	(Laughter) ...	SC
33139	625112	Roger. Hear a few chuckles coming from that direction. And we do have a late report on the sports here also. The All Star game currently being played. The present score at the end of the fourth inning has the National League leading the American League by 9 to 3. So the hitters are having a good day, you can tell.	CC
33140	625134	And rain clouds are over the MSC area at the moment. It began raining here just about 10 minutes ago, and last report, we were having a pretty heavy deluge. So, that's it from the news front for the afternoon here, Apollo 11. Over.	CC
33141	625159	Thank you very much, Owen. I think my yard could use some water.	CDR
33142	625163	That's very true. I've forgotten exactly how many days it did go, Buzz, but something like 30 days without rain; and we can aprreciate the rain we're getting right now.	CC
33143	625174	That was Neil. This is Buzz, here. I wish we could find out when the last time my lawn was cut. Over.	LMP
33144	625179	That might be a little more difficult to find out. I'm not sure whether the - whether Mike is ready to admit when he last did the job, but I'll look into that for you.	CMP
33145	625191	Well, he'll tell you. He's got a new mower.	LMP
33146	625193	Roger.	CC
33147	625204	Hey, ask my chinch bugs how they're toing?	CMP
33148	625207	Well, I'm not sure about your's. I can let you know about my own, and the report isn't very good.	CC
33149	625665	11, Houston. Over.	CC
33150	625670	Go ahead.	LMP
33151	625671	Roger. Joan wasn't home right now, Buzz, but Janis reports the grass is getting pretty high, and I would estimate that it's going to be close to your knees by the time you get out of quarantine. Over.	CC
33152	625688	Okay. I'll have to schedule a little discussion after I get back.	LMP
33153	625693	Roger. And no reports - no report from the chinch bugs there, Mike.	CC
33154	625701	Well, they're sort of taciturn little fellows. They don't say much; they just chomp away.	CMP
33155	625706	Concur on that.	CC
33156	625727	Which is about what we're doing up here.	CMP
33157	625732	We concur on that, too.	CC
33158	625758	Breakfast was magnificent as usual. I had sliced peaches, sausage patties, two cups of coffee, and I forget all what else.	CMP
33159	625767	That does sound pretty good. As a matter of fact, I'm way overdue for a meal myself, here. I could use some of that.	CC
33160	625790	Why don't you get Milt to give you 5 minutes off and grab a hamburger?	CMP
33161	625800	I suggested that awhile ago. He was pointing out about the weight problem here. We've got to keep the calories low, so I'd better stand by without it.	CC
33162	625966	Houston, Apollo 11. We've been doing a little flight planning for Apollo 12 up here.	CMP
33163	625974	Roger. Go ahead.	CC
33164	625977	We're trying to calculate how much spagetti and meatballs we can get on board for Al Bean.	CMP
33165	625985	I'm not sure the spacecraft will take that much extra weight. Have you made any estimates?	CC
33166	625992	It'll be close.	CMP
33167	626152	11, Houston. The medics at the next console report that the shrew is one animal which can eat six times its own body weight every 24 hours. This may be a satisfactory base line for your spaghetti calculations on Al Bean. Over.	CC
33168	626171	Okay. Thank you. That's in work.	CMP
33169	626355	Houston, Apollo 11. It was slightly colder in here last night than it has been on any previous night. Does EECOMM notice any change in his data or any explanation for that?	CMP
33170	626365	Roger. Stand by just a moment. We've got to check some temperatures.	CC
33171	626375	Up until last night it was - if anything, a little on the warm side at night. Last night it was on the chilly side.	CMP
33172	626383	Roger there. We'll run down the temperatures for the 2 nights.	CC
33173	626390	Oh, it's no big thing. Just as a matter of interest.	CMP
33174	626392	Roger.	CC
33175	626405	And how'd you like the command module RCS temperatures?	CMP
33176	626417	11, Houston. They all look very good. The lowest temperature was 40 degrees, and we're taking a look at your cabin temperatures now.	CC
33177	626427	We agree on the CM RCS. No heaters are going 2 to be required by a country mile.	CMP
33178	626438	We think that's correct.	CC
33179	626450	We don't like those heaters, anyway, working off the direct coils.	CMP

33181	626494	Peculiar thing, Owen, on the platform alignment is that when I really take my time and do a very slow, careful, precise job of marking. I'm getting about the same star angle difference as when I'm doing it in DTC and have to do a hurried rush job with relatively poor tracking. Star angle differences seem insensitive. It almost made me believe there's a very small bias there somewhere in the sextant.	CMP
33182	626527	Roger, 11. Perhaps the 3 degrees per second just isn't that much of a bother. Over.	CC
33183	626536	Well, he's really trying to explain why he can't get all zeros.	LMP
33184	626540	I think Buzz is probably right. As a matter of fact, one time I made a mark which I thought was a little bit in error, but I tho thought, "Well heck. I'll go ahead and see how it works out anyway," and I got five zeros that time. And when I have thought everything was exactly precisely on, I have consistently been getting 0.01.	CMP
33185	626572	Roger. Apparently it pays to hurry.	CC
33186	626579	I usually do.	CMP
33187	626587	The visibility through the telescope has been very poor. It's, I would say, even worse than the simulator is right now. It requires long periods of dark adaptation which most times are most inconvenient; so it's really a tremendous asset to keep the platform powered up at all times and to keep it tweaked within the capability of the sextant field of view.	CMP
33188	626617	Understand, Mike.	CC
33189	626707	11, Houston. Checking your temperatures, it does look like the spacecraft may have cooled down perhaps 2 or 3 degrees in the last 24 hours, and that sounds to be consistent with your report on the comfort level there. Over.	CC
33190	626725	Okay.	CMP
33191	626729	Is that a LM off phenomenon?	CDR
33192	626759	11, Houston. It looks like we'll have to think a little more about that, as to whether it's a LM off or some effect of being out of Lunar orbit. We don't know, so we'll have to puzzle before we can give a better answer.	CC
33193	626772	Okay.	CDR
33194	626775	Well, if the systems guys have anything they want chased down, we'll be happy to give you any readings or reports or what have you.	CMP
33195	626783	Roger. We'll think about that and see if there aren't some other tests to be usefully performed here.	CC
33196	626791	Okay.	CMP
33197	627189	11, Houston. I'll be turning things over to the Green CAP COMM at this time, and see you on the ground tomorrow.	CC
33198	627205	Okay, Owen. I want to thank you and the whole Purple/Maroon group there for a good job helping Apollo 11.	CDR
33199	627215	Thank you, sir.	CC
33200	627221	Thanks from us to all of you. It was really appreciated.	LMP
33201	627225	Great job, you guys.	CMP

33203	627990	Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.	CC
33204	627994	Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11.	CMP
33205	627997	11, this is Houston. With reference to your subjective evaluation that it felt cooler in side the spacecraft last night, we reported earlier that we did indeed see a drop of about 3 degrees over the previous night. Looking back, it appears the crew of Apollo 10 reported similar feelings during the translunar and transearth coast phases. We're wondering if you could give us any indication of the relative amounts of free or condensed water in the cabin last night and the night before from which we could infer humidity. Over.	CC
33206	628047	Roger. That might be a little bit difficult to do. We'll take a look at the tunnel now. It does seem as though, between the dirt, we had a little bit more moisture in the tunnel. Of course, the LM hadn't been vented when we did translunar.	CDR
33207	628065	Roger. We were more curious about the relative amount of moisture between, say, last night and the night before, both of which would have the LM missing.	CC
33208	628084	There's more moisture in the tunnel now than there has been at any previous time. Subjectively we have been unable to determine any change in - any buildup in humidity. There appears to be no moisture any other place in the spacecraft. For example, the windows are not fogging or - and various other cool spots around the spacecraft - all of them appear to be completely dry.	CMP
33209	628115	This is Houston. Roger. Thank you.	CC
33210	628927	How are all the "Greens" today, Bruce?	CMP
33211	628934	Oh, the Greens are in good shape. The actual Green Team has been here for several hours. We're dogging the watch down here to position Ron for entry. Over.	CC
33212	628945	Roger. Understand. Did Dave Reed get to explain the lunar ... at the press conference?	CMP
33213	628952	No, but your comments about Bill Shaffer and the explanations were quoted in the paper last night.	CC
33214	628960	Oh, oh.	CMP
33215	628965	Do you want to say anything more while you're on the line?	CC
33216	628971	He's right. He's absolutely right.	CMP
33217	629045	How's old White, Bruce? Did he ever let you go get a cup of coffee when we were over on the back side?	CMP
33218	629055	Oh, things have been going pretty smoothly down here. He's really not that hard to get along with.	CC
33219	629061	Oh, he must be mellowing.	CMP
33220	629063	We've only got two of them back here right now.	CC
33221	629070	He always used to make me sit at the console through the back side passes, just for training.	CMP
33222	629081	Well, the word we have here is - that was because whenever you came back, you had to be retrained.	CC
33223	629090	TouchÃ©.	CMP
33224	629468	Houston, Apollo 11. Out of curiosity, on those 70 mm cameras, we figure we exposed around 300 in the LM and around a thousand in the command module; and both cameras - or all the 70 mm cameras worked just fine.	CMP
33225	629486	Okay. Very good. Thank you.	CC

33230	630456	July 23.	CC
33231	630459	I'm not sure that we hung around long enough to pick that one up.	CDR
33232	630464	Okay. If you've got the entry operations checklist handy, then I'll pass it up to you. Over.	CC
33233	630473	How can you make changes after lift off?	CDR
33234	630484	You sure you don't mean June?	CMP
33235	630486	Negative. It just came up today. Over.	CC
33236	630492	So, you're the first to get to us. Go ahead.	CMP
33237	630498	Okay. On page 6 1 of the entry out checklist down toward the bottom after "MAIN DEPLOY pushbutton," we have three additional steps we'd like you to accomplish. The intent of this is to reduce the oxygen pressure in your manifold and to eliminate the oxygen bleed flow through the potable and waste water tanks during descent. Over.	CC
33238	630536	Okay. We've got 6 1 out. Go ahead.	CMP
33239	630540	Okay. Down at the bottom, you've got "10,000 feet MAIN PARACHUTE DEPLOY, MAIN DEPLOY pushbutton, PUSH within 1 second." And after that step, we'd like you insert "SURGE TANK O2 valve, OFF; REPRESS PACKAGE valve, OFF; and DIRECT O2 valve, OPEN." Do you copy?	CC
33240	630589	Okay. Down at the bottom, after "MAIN DEPLOY pushbutton, PUSH; SURGE TANK O2, OFF; and REPRESS PACKAGE VALVE, OFF, DIRECT O2, ON" Over.	CMP
33241	630604	Roger. And then down at the very botton of page 6 2 where you see "DIRECT O2, OFF VERIFY," delete that step completely. Over.	CC
33242	630620	Roger.	CMP
33243	630622	And for record purposes, this will be "Change Lima." Over.	CC
33244	630630	Okay. We've got it. How far open do you want this the DIRECT O2 valve to be opened at this point? I guess you want it - just leave it open from that point on?	CMP
33245	630646	Roger. It should go all the way open, and you can just leave it on from that point on. The intent is to completely depressurize the oxygen manifold. Over.	CC
33246	630659	Roger. Copy.	CMP

33250	630965	Having done their job I guess.	CMP
33251	630970	Well, along with one tree, it turns out.	CC
33252	630975	Yes. I heard about that. That was right before the flight.	CMP
33253	630978	Right. That big storm.	CC
33254	635035	Apollo 11, this is Houston. Are you still up there? Over.	CC
33255	635047	Yes, we are. But not quite so far as we were a while ago.	CDR
33256	635052	Roger. We concur. We just wanted to make sure that we had good COMM with you.	CC
33257	635058	Okay.	CDR
33258	635186	For general information, 11, you are now 95,970 miles out from the Earth. Over.	CC

33284	639099	Okay.	CDR
33285	639112	Okay. You're coming through loud and clear now, 11, with your patch.	CC
33286	639144	Good evening. This is the Commander of Apollo 11. A hundred years ago, Jules Verne wrote a book about a voyage to the Moon. His spaceship, Columbia, took off from Florida and landed in the Pacific Ocean after completing a trip to the Moon. It seems appropriate to us to share with you some of the reflections of the crew as the modern day Columbia completes its rendezvous with the planet Earth and the same Pacific Ocean tomorrow. First, Mike Collins.	CDR
33287	639215	11, this is Houston. We have an LOS here.	CC
33288	639219	We'll be right back with you.	CDR

33290	639231	In the interim, you may be interested in knowing that Jan and the children and Pat and the youngsters and Andy Aldrin are down here in the viewing room watching this evening.	CC
33291	639245	We're glad to hear that.	CDR
33292	639278	Okay, 11. You're back on, with Mike in the middle of the screen there.	CC
33293	639284	Roger. This trip of ours to the Moon may have looked, to you, simple or easy. I'd like to assure you that has not been the case. The Saturn V rocket which put us into orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly. This computer up above my head has a 38,000 word vocabulary, each word of which has been very carefullly chosen to be of the utmost value to us, the crew. This switch which I have in my hand now, has over 300 counterparts in the command module alone, this one single switch design. In addition to that, there are myriads of circuit breakers, levers, rods, and other associated controls. The SPS engine, our large rocket engine on the aft end of our service module, must have performed flawlessly, or we would have been stranded in lunar orbit. The parachutes up above my head must work perfectly tomorrow or we will plummet into the	CMP
33294	639472	11, this is Houston. We're getting a good picture of Buzz now, but no voice modulation. And would you open up the f stop on the TV camera; try 22, please?	CC
33295	639493	That appears to be a lot better now. We're still not receiving Buzz's audio.	CC
33296	639500	Good evening. I'd like to discuss with you a few of the more symbolic aspects of the flight of our mission, Apollo 11. As we've been discussing the events that have taken place in the past 2 or 3 days here on board our spacecraft, we've come to the conclusion that this has been far more than three men on a voyage to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown. Neil's statement the other day upon first setting foot on the surface of the Moon, "This is a small step for a man, but a great leap for mankind," I believe sums up these feelings very nicely. We accepted the challenge of going to the Moon; the acceptance of this challenge was inevitable. The relative ease with which we carried out our mission, I believe, is a tribute to the timeliness of that acceptance. Today, I feel we're fully capable of accepting expanded roles in the exploration of space. In retrospect, we have all been particularly pleased with the call signs that we very laboriouslychose for our spacecraft, Columbia and Eagle. We've been particularly pleased with the emblem of our flight, depicting the U.S. eagle bringing the universal symbol of peace from the Earth, from the planet Earth to the Moon; that symbol being the olive branch. It was our overall crew choice to deposit a replica of this symbol on the Moon. Personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind to me. "When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars which Thou hast ordained, what is man that Thou art mindful of him."	LMP
33297	639702	The responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have through their will, indicated their desire; next, to four administrations, and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, to the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the space suit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We would like to give a special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft, who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their - their hearts and all their abilities into those crafts. To those people, tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.	CDR
33298	639832	11, this is Houston. We're getting a zoom view out the window now.	CC
33299	639864	Apollo 11, signing off.	CDR
33300	640068	Houston, Apollo 11. Do you want to crank up PTC again; do you have some reason to hold its attitude, or what's your pleasure?	CMP
33301	640077	You can crank up PTC again, Mike, any time you like. And I might add I thought that was a mighty fine TV presentation. There's certainly nothing I can add to it from down here.	CC
33302	640090	Thank you.	CMP

33304	640413	Go ahead.	CDR
33305	640416	Okay, 11. I've got a few small items here: one flight plan update and some entry photography information, if you are ready to copy. Over.	CC
33306	640429	Go ahead.	CDR
33307	640431	Roger. At 180 hours 50 minutes GET, we should like to delete your oxygen fuel cell purge.	CC
33308	640442	Okay.	CDR
33309	640443	And on the entry photography, if you are going to use a fresh magazine of color interior film, we recommend the following exposure settings: f11 at 1/250, six frames per second, focus on 7 feet for the fireball; f2.0, 1/60 of a second, six frames per second, focus on 50 feet when the chutes open. If you are using a magazine, part of which has already been used for interior shots, we recommend f16 at 1/500 of a second, six frames per second, focus on 7 feet for the fireball; f2.8, 1/60 of a second, six frames per second, focus on 50 feet when the parachutes open. And we would like to know the magazine number that you are intending to use if you have a chance. Over.	CC
33310	640522	Okay. I think we got those. We will be using a fresh one and it will be color interior. Over.	CMP
33311	640532	Roger. When you get - get it out, we would like to have the number of the magazine and the letter of the magazine relayed down.	CC
33312	640542	Okay. And we're thinking that we might want to run some of that at 12 frames per second. And I think we can get everything from 0.5 - 0.5g down; that will only give us about 7.8 minutes and ... frames ... double that. I guess maybe just an occasional burst to 12 frames would be what we want and the rest of it at six. Over.	CDR
33313	640583	This is Houston. That plan sounds fine with us, Neil.	CC
33314	640588	Okay.	CDR
33315	640590	And lastly, we would like to know if your stowage configuration for entry is going to conform to	CC

33414	653765	Roger, Mike. We sure did. We're ready to talk about it, if you are. Over.	CC
33415	653773	I think the quickest thing is to go through page by page, the first part of the entry checklist where it has a map. Starting on the page with compartment L2 and L3. Are you with me?	CMP
33416	653785	Roger. With you.	CC
33417	653788	Okay. L2 is as shown. L3 is as shown; there is about half the food remaining in L3.	CMP
33418	653795	Roger.	CC
33419	653796	Where it says - where it says "And note," the CMPPGA is located in the L shaped bag with the other two PGA's. The LM shield was jettisoned with the - Correction, the CMP's helmet shield was jettisoned with the LM, and his helmet and gloves, instead of being in the sleep restraint, are in the hatch bags.	CMP
33420	653826	Okay. Let's see now. Your PGA is in the L shaped bag with the other two PGA's, and your helmet and gloves are in the L shaped bag instead of the sleep restraint.	CC
33421	653841	The helmet and gloves are in the hatch bag, the great big bag that's underneath the left hand couch that you put the hatch in.	CMP
33422	653850	Roger. I thought I - That's what I copied. Okay. Go ahead.	CC
33423	653857	Okay. The next page is identical except a nitpicking point: out R1 we got the entry checklist. Other than that it is identical, and the third page has got some changes.	CMP
33424	653869	Go ahead.	CC
33425	653870	In A1 - Are you with me? I'm over there in compartment A1, now.	CMP

33427	653884	In compartment A1, the 16 millimeter magazine will be located in window number 4 instead of 5. Tissue dispensers; there is only one of them left. And compartment U3, the 16 millimeter bracket is on window 4, and the PGA bag - add the CMP's PGA, plus add two LCG's. And compartment A8 delete two LCG's, add one PPK, making a total of four, and add 10 pounds of LM miscellaneous equipment. We told you five the other day. We think ten is probably closer. Over.	CMP
33428	653937	Copy.	CC
33429	653944	And that's all the changes on that page. Ready for the next page?	CMP
33430	653947	Roger. Go ahead, Mike.	CC
33431	653952	On your next page, in compartment B1, we estimate about 15 percent of that food is remaining. In B2 we took PPK out of there and put trash in it. In B3, the 16 millimeter cable, the 18 millimeter lens, and the right angle mirror are on window number 4. And that there brings you all up to date.	CMP
33432	653982	Roger. How about the LEVVA's, Mike? Where did you put those? Over.	CC
33433	653993	They're in the hatch bag.	CMP
33434	653996	Roger. Stand by. Our only concern, 11, is with the stuff you got in the hatch bag. That's pretty big bulk between you and A8, and we'd like to talk about moving that over to the sleep restraint. If you will stand by. I'll verify that. Over.	CC
33435	654016	Okay.	CMP
33436	654076	11, Houston. Our recommendation on the gear you got in the helmet bag - correction, hatch bag, would be to remove that stuff and put it in the sleep restraint under the right couch. The reason is that the hatch bag straps are only configured for zero g, and it is a pretty difficult job getting it lashed down. With the gear in the sleep restraint, it's a pretty standard lash down procedure, and you could also use the Beta cord that you have on hoard. You concur? Over.	CC
33437	654123	Yes. We'll look at it, Charlie, and let you know.	CMP
33438	654126	Roger. And I got a couple of other things, Mike. We need to terminate battery B charge at this time, and also, the weather is clobbering in at our targeted landing point due to scattered thunderstorms. We don't want to tangle with one of those, so we are going to move the - your aim point uprange. Correction, it will be downrange, to target for 1500 nautical mile entry so we can guarantee uplift control. The new coordinates are 13 degrees, 19 minutes north, 169 10 minutes west. The weather in that area is super. We got 2000 scattered, 8000 scattered with 10 miles visibility and 6 foot seas and the Hornet is sitting in great position to get to that targeted positton. Over.	CC
33439	654201	Roger.	CMP
33440	654719	Apollo 11, Houston. Some of the general last minute updates here. On the entry, we had told you on the camera to set it at 50 feet. It turns out the biggest number on the camera is 25 feet, so just set it at infinity. Over.	CC

33472	685188	Okay. Apollo 11 remains the prime story with the world awaiting your landing today at about 11 49 a.m. Houston time. In Washington, House tax reformers have fashioned a provision which would make it impossible for wealthy individuals to avoid income tax entirely through tax free investments or special allowances. Under the proposal tentatively adopted by the House Ways and Means Committee, everyone would pay taxes on at least half of their income.	CC

33476	685356	Roger. Continuing with the Maroon Bugle. President Nixon surprised your wives with a phone call from San Francisco just before he boarded a plane to fly out to meet you. All of them were very touched by your television broadcast. Jan and Pat watched from Mission Control here. The launch of Intelsat from the Cape was postponed for the fourth time last night. The problem was said to be a malfunctioning nitrogen regulator in the second stage of Delta. A new attempt will be made to launch it tonight. The research submarine Ben Franklin, which is studying the Gulf Stream, set a record by drifting 24 hours from 10 to 100 feet above the ocean floor in 1300 feet of water off the Georgia coast. The mission is led by Jacques Picard. Wally Schirra has been elected to a 5 year term on the board of trustees of the Detroit Institute of Technology. He will serve on the Institute's development committee. Air Canada says it has accepted 2300 reservations for flights to the Moon in the past 5 days. It might be noted that more than 100 have been made by men for their mothers in law. And finally, it appears that rather than killing romantic songs about the Moon, you have inspired hundreds of song writers. Nashville, Tennessee, which probably houses the largest collection of recording companies and song publishers in the country, now reports it is being flooded by Moon songs. Some will make it. The song at the top of the best sellers list this week is, "In the year 2525." Morning Bugle. Out.	CC

33521	690674	Okay. On page E6 1, your RRT is 07 20, your 50K is 08 16; 40K is 08 30; your 24K is 09 02; and your 10K is 09 51. 0wer.	CC
33522	690726	Okay. RRT, 07 20, 50 000, 08 16. That's - 07 20 is - is the time of steam pressure peg from RRT; and 40 000, 08 30; 24 000, 09 02; 10 000, 09 51.	LMP
33523	690768	11, Houston. You started out right, and then the numbers you read back were correct; but I didn't get your comment in between there.	CC

33526	690786	Okay.	LMP
33527	691085	Houston, Apollo 11. Ron, I'm ready to copy your message about the constant drag level.	CMP
33528	691093	Okay, Mike. Of course, this is in the event the G&N and the EMS quits and you have to fly the constant g; and what we're trying to do is extend the constant g range from 1100 to 1500 miles. We've run this procedure in the simulator, and it works fine. Basically, I'll go through it - just go through it, and then if you have any questions come back. But it's the same lift vector up until MAX g, and then lift vector down, and then modulate the lift vector until g dot goes to zero. Okay. This procedure is essentially the same so far. And then hold g dot zero until you pass the RETRO elapsed time of V circular; and then after you pass this RETRO elapsed time of V circular, roll to a gimbal angle of 45 degrees, and then hold this constant bank angle of 45 degrees until you come to the RETRO elapsed time of drogues. Over.	CC
33529	691184	Okay. It sounds straightforward enough. Understand constant g backup backup procedure, lift vector up until MAX g and then lift vector down; then modulate until bank angle until g dot equals zero. Maintain g dot equals zero until subcircular, then roll 45 degrees and hold until drogue time. Over.	CMP
33530	691207	Okay. That's mighty fine, Mike. That's correct.	CC
33531	694917	This entry time line is my kind of time line. Nice and slow.	CMP

33551	695156	Thank you, sir.	CMP
33552	695229	Houston, Apollo 11 has got VHF A Simplex on whenever you want to make a COMM check.	LMP
33553	695240	Apollo 11, Houston. Roger. You faded out a little bit there, Buzz. I understand you have the VHF Simplex A on now. Is that correct? Over.	CC
33554	695249	That affirmative. VHF Simplex A and we're TR on VHF.	LMP
33555	695255	Roger. Mighty fine. We'll watch it as you are coming on in and let you know when the intelligibility is up. We'll make a voice check with you at that time.	CC
33556	695270	Houston, Apollo 11. I've been holding here in SCS control MINIMUM DEADBAND RATE LOW with the limit cycle on, just as a matter of curiosity, if you guys wanted some fuel numbers from that.	CDR
33557	695287	11, Houston. Roger. We copy and we've been figuring it out.	CC
33558	695293	Okay.	CDR

33562	695777	Go ahead.	CMP
33563	695778	Roger. The Hornet is on station just far enough off the target point to keep from getting hit. Recovery 1, or the chopper, is there; they're on station. And Hawaii Rescue 1 and 2, the C 130's, are within 40 minutes of your target point. Over.	CC
33564	695810	Sounds good. Thank you.	CMP
33565	696308	Apollo 11, Houston.	CC

33568	696326	Okay. That's about right.	LMP
33569	696328	Okay. Looks like we're together on that, and I guess we're standing by for you to whip into the entry attitude.	CC
33570	696337	Okay. We've just been taking a couple of last minute pictures. We've finished the EMS entry check, primary water EVAP activation.	LMP

33577	696708	We can see the Moon passing by the window and it looks what I considered to be a correct size.	CMP
33578	696806	Houston, Apollo 11. Like to switch to S band OMNI C. I just did a minute ago, and noticed a loss of signal strength, over.	LMP
33579	696814	Roger, Apollo 11. Go ahead and try it again now that you're in attitude.	CC
33580	696822	Roger. Going OMNI C.	LMP

33587	697667	That's affirmative, we completed the P52. We'll give you the data from it in just a second. We passed our sextant star check at entry attitude, and right now we're maneuvering to our first horizon cheek pitch attitude of 298 degrees.	CDR
33588	697685	Roger. Copy that, 11.	CC
33589	698333	Apollo 11, Houston. About 4 minutes to 1 hour, and I'll give you a mark at 1 hour. Was a command module preheat necessary? Over.	CC
33590	698343	Negative that.	CMP
33591	698346	Roger. Copy. Negative command module preheat.	CC
33592	698526	Apollo 11, Houston.	CC
33593	698529	Go ahead.	CMP
33594	698531	Roger. We don't want to jettison the hydrogen tank that stratified, so could you cycle the fans in tank 2 please? Hydrogen tank 2.	CC
33595	698546	You better believe, that old service module has taken good care of us. We want to take good care of it.	CMP
33596	698550	It sure has, hasn't it.	CC
33597	698553	It's been a champ.	CMP

33615	699158	Roger, 11. Houston. You're loud. The standard VHF noise, though, makes you realize that S band is good.	CC
33616	699168	Roger. Understand. Thank you.	LMP
33617	699199	Apollo 11, Houston. Backup S band now, and we're standing by for command module RCS aetivation.	CC

33630	699883	Roger. The first horizon check 194 23 06 at a pitch angle of 298 does not quite fall on the 31 7 line. It's just a little high. It's within 5 degrees tolerance.	LMP
33631	699897	Apollo 11, Houston. The horizon check there was supposed to be at 33. Over.	CC

33647	700379	Okay. I'll probably only be doing it maybe - part of it at six frames a second, some it at one. So I could be changing settings as it goes through.	LMP
33648	700389	Roger. Copy.	CC
33649	700399	And the horizon check passes; it's right on the money.	CMP

33672	701854	11, Houston. That's negative. All you have to do is turn it on. That'll be fine.	CC
33673	701864	I guess I don't know how to turn it on, then. I got PCM, ANTILOG RECORD, FORWARD; high bit rate, and barber pole.	LMP
33674	701883	11, Houston. We'll send the ON command from down here, see if it works.	CC
33675	701887	Okay.	LMP

33684	702142	Okay. That will be fine. On 225, there, if you can reach it, Buzz, the last two circuit breakers in the second row from the bottom, punch those in.	CC
33685	702162	And 11, Houston, don't mess around with that 225 there.	CC
