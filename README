Second to second replay of the Apollo 11 mission radio logs. 
Enacted as dialogue between spacecraft and earth staff. 

HOWTO

1. Use the apollo.csv file included to create a database with the following metadata

mysql> describe apollo_transcripts;
+--------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field        | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+--------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| id           | int(11)     | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment | 
| mission_time | int(11)     | YES  | MUL | NULL    |                | 
| comms        | text        | YES  |     | NULL    |                | 
| speaker      | varchar(50) | YES  |     | NULL    |                | 
+--------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+

2. Install my Assumptions minimalist MVC framework for perl

3. Install the perl script to read sections from this log

4. Fix the FIXMEs in the perl script. DB connection, and the time for lift off in the reenactment

5. Point the index.html to your perl script

6. LIFTOFF!!
